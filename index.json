[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI have always been a huge Pink Floyd fan. Despite what my Spotify stats tell (which I listen to Nick Cave more), Pink Floyd have always had a special place in my music and life. They are the band that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to classify, or rate, nor rank. They are outside every category. They stay on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down the other day and thought of the best Pink Floyd songs, or at least my favourite ones. I came up with a list, but soon enough scratched that. I thought it would be far more interesting and original to list only their songs that somehow elicit specific images in my head when I listen to them. A few bands manage to do it, and Pink Floyd have the most songs that I associate a precise vibe and image with. These images are not necessarily associated with what the song is about; they are just what they make me think about and feel. It is a completely personal list, wholly different from anybody else\u0026rsquo;s. Still, I find it curious how these associations were born and why, and I thought it worth to write them here for posterity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a completely personal blog, yes, meaningless to you.

I feel immediately his absence at the first notes. After his death I associated this song with him, with the relationship that we failed to have, with his efforts, meagre and clumsy, and our shared passions (football mainly). It is a song that remembers me not of the pain of his death but of the lack of the opportunity to have a relationship that would be beneficial to both with him anymore.

Near a cliff, somewhere in England, north France or Ireland. The sky is gloomy, windy, and there’s gonna be rain. A few people are honouring the dead here and there, all clad in black.

There’s much to rebuild, much to fix, but there’s a vibrant youth that will do it. Walking alone at night through the streets of Berlin, headphones on, listening to hard music. A sense of possibilities is lingering, with me feeling just a passing observer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"comfortably-numb-the-wall\"\u003eComfortably Numb (The Wall)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis song is many things but primarily two. One is the sadness of lost youth, the lack of a second chance, to rebuild what was destroyed, of recovering the joy of looking at the world with fresh eyes. The thing is a violet sky with dark clouds over the sea, me on a pier or along the beach, looking at the sky and wondering what the future will reserve me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious how this song is associated to me both with past and future.

This song has a strong connection with the 80s, the cruise ships of old, calm nights, the sense of peace that I associate with that age (and my childhood years). Specifically though this song makes me feel as I were on Fatu Hiva, one of the Marquesas in French Polynesia, looking at the sea while sipping a drink (may be a classic Mai Tai but also any rum-based cocktail), considering the possibilities and the future, on the first evening after I sailed across the Pacific on my sailboat to land at the Marquesas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis song elicits a specific scene like with no other song, and such a peculiar place that I have been wondering why for years, without being capable of giving myself an answer. I have never been in French Polynesia but I kind of \u0026ldquo;remember\u0026rdquo; Fatu Hiva, probably from some episode of an old tv series of the 1980s that I stumbled upon as a little kid. Why that specific place caught my attention all these years back and got associated with this song is unfathomable to me. But it is contributing to giving me a direction in life, in fueling the dream of doing the passage from Panama to the Marquesas on my own sailboat one day, and living this scene while playing the song.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"Or at least those who elicit a specific image when I play them","image":"/blog/favourite-pink-floyd-songs/fatu_hiva_bay_with_sailboats.jpg","permalink":"https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/favourite-pink-floyd-songs/","title":"Favourite Pink Floyd songs"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI never loved flying. I tolerated it in the beginning. Then grew fond of it. Until it became the worst possible way of transportation there is. Now I am considering renouncing flying altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounded a bit dramatic, didn\u0026rsquo;t it? Oh well, imagine how strong is my frustration with flying then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePremise: I am an old flyer. I started boarding planes in the mid 1990s. Before low cost airlines, before the concept of going through an international hub to reach your final destination was born. If you wanted to fly back then, 99% of the times it was your national flag carrier airline, within Europe, and for longer flights there were alliances that meant you were sent to another national airline somewhere closer to your final destination. It was normal to have 2, max 3 flights to reach even the most remote location in the world. You flew from your local airport to a national/international hub, then to the other company\u0026rsquo;s hub, then to your final destination. Services like seat reservation, sizeable hand luggage, a simple meal, water/coffee/tea/soft drinks were all naturally included in the price of your tickets. Even in 30 minutes flight a sweet or cookie was given without costs. On some companies, beer and wine were also freely given with the cheapest ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not in love with flying back then. But I learned how comfortable was to come to the airport 1,5 hours before your departure and be at destination in a handful of hours. You could bring with you any amounts of liquids, nobody blinked an eye. Going through security was mostly a matter of exposing your electronics and removing anything metallic from your pockets. If you were flying outside of your home country, you could find amazing deals on cigarettes, tobacco-related products, and alcohol at foreign airports. A bottle of your favourite spirit could cost one third less than at home. Thank God for the duty free shop! For me it was a ritual to spend some time shopping in airports before coming back home in search of hot deals. Which were regularly found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, everything changed for the worse\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"flying-today-is-a-stressful-experience\"\u003eFlying today is a stressful experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnybody that asserts that loves flying today must be a masochist. You at most tolerate it, if you are sane of mind. The panorama of flying has dramatically turned sour in the last 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"flying_over_the_atlantic.jpg\" alt=\"Flying over the Atlantic\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"seats-are-getting-tinier-and-tinier\"\u003eSeats are getting tinier and tinier\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not mystery that airlines have been trying to squeeze as much earnings per flight as possible for years. Which meant actually \u003cstrong\u003esqueezing people\u003c/strong\u003e in \u003ca href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-08-11/airlines-have-been-shrinking-seats\"\u003eshrinking seats\u003c/a\u003e that have lost up to 10cm in legroom over the last 10 years. Flying has become physically painful for some, and certainly less enjoyable for everybody. Even low cost long range buses have better legroom sometimes than planes. For a fraction of the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not particularly tall, just your average white European man here, but can\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking how in the 1990s you had way more legroom for similar ticket prices. I am not considering the low cost carriers here as Ryanair, but comparing the likes of British, Lufthansa, Alitalia, Iberia and so on from once to today. And invariably there is less space for each passenger than in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally I can resist 2-3 hours in economy just ok. But longer flights on today\u0026rsquo;s seats are a nightmare. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be allowed to fly 5-10 hours on such small seats, with little room to move around. Especially if the save in rates is non-existent compared to the same companies 15-20 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, planes have the added problem that unless you take a aisle seat, you are forced to wake up or ask other passengers to be able to move around the plane. Not that you can go much farther than the toilette, or briefly standing in the corridor. There is really nothing to do on planes outside of your seat. They are basically made to make you stay seated at all times, for obvious security reasons. Thus, suffer for a few hours in your tiny seat, next to foreigners, and God forbid you think of spending half the flight standing, as crew and other passengers will stumble upon you every couple of minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"id-rather-starve-than-eat-in-airports-again\"\u003eI\u0026rsquo;d rather starve than eat in airports again\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twist on the common \u0026ldquo;food on planes taste terrible\u0026rdquo;, I have had enough of overpriced, bland, advertised as typical, buy-and-eat in a rush, food at airports. Seriously, I am not saying that there\u0026rsquo;s no ok food to be had before flights but the times I had a decent meal can be counted on a single hand\u0026rsquo;s fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not looking to spend 40EUR for a dry pork cutlet, shakingly resting over questionably-looking potatoes (true story). Nor 3EUR for a bottle of water that mere metres outside of the same airport costs half that. Airport food has become such a scam at this point that unless you are one of those traveling in business class with complimentary access to your airline\u0026rsquo;s lounge, I\u0026rsquo;d rather not eat anything for hours than wasting money on this food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, arguably, lounges are also offering quite overpriced food. But the feeling that it is included in what you already paid makes it feel like it is better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"plane_meal.jpg\" alt=\"Typical plane meal\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not like 20 years ago starred restaurants were available in most airports or that any drink was priced the same as outside them. I am not painting such a rosy image of the days of old. But food was not so overpriced as today, and choice was not so limited either. The number of Starbucks, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, generic Asian joint, and overtly touristic \u0026ldquo;brasserie\u0026rdquo; has doubled over the years. Eating at Heathrow or Brandeburg or Malpensa or Singapore isn\u0026rsquo;t much different anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"duty-free\"\u003eDuty \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least while waiting for your next flight once you could enjoy shopping at luxury and non stores inside the airport. I remember prices for spirits or tobacco being sometimes much cheaper than at home. I stroke quite a few deals on eau de toilette and found the Spanish ham I was aiming to take home wasn\u0026rsquo;t criminally overpriced over the same that I ogled at during my Spain vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a decade ago, minimum. Nowadays I have seen more and more luxury stores a-la Gucci, Rolex, Longchamp, Armani, with over-the-top prices, and fewer and fewer of \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; stores, of local brands, with local products. Those are left in huge \u0026ldquo;duty free\u0026rdquo; stores that have become less and less \u0026ldquo;duty free\u0026rdquo;, if they are at all anymore. I regularly find cigars to be priced above what I can buy at home, perfumes are at least the same price you can find in your local Sephora store, and even those ubiquitous fridge magnets cost the same as if you bought them in front of Tour Eiffel, the Colosseo, the Topkapi or right in the middle of Ubud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho buys at these stores anymore? Are you all supremely rich that can throw 5EUR at a magnet, 150EUR at a 100ml eau de toilette or 1000EUR for a middle-sized bag? And if you are, why don\u0026rsquo;t you have your own private jet instead of flying with us plebeians?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThing is, I see no point anymore in spending any second browsing through stores that are either the same everywhere you travel to, or offer stuff that is so out of my budget that makes me board the flight feeling an homeless guy. It is depressing thinking that what was once a pleasure, and part of the travel experience, has been so exploited by greed that it is completely ruined for the most of us, average workers. Last time I actually bought something that was not food or water at an airport was probably 7-8 years ago. That part of the experience of flying has died out. Now I just ensure that I am early enough to catch the flight and go through security as fast as possible, heading straight to my gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings me to the next complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"security-is-getting-more-convoluted\"\u003eSecurity is getting more convoluted\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last few years, I noticed that security checks have become weirder, and occasionally truly crazy. Even in the immediate months after 11/09 it was not that difficult to go through security. It was a matter of taking out your electronics, all your metal stuff in pockets, your belt and, perhaps, your shoes. Nearly all airports followed these rules, and you had to do it \u003cstrong\u003eonce\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow? Even thrice for a single flight. And it seems there is no consistency whatsoever across airports. In some you must remove shoes, in others you can even keep keys inside your pockets. In others all electronics go out of the bag, in a few they cared only about laptop and tablet, but I could keep my GoPro, power bank, and camera inside. I inevitably get checked from time to time because the scan detected something on me at an airport but later in the day, with the same clothes on, at a different airport I pass through just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brings me to the craziest and most infuriating change about security in recent years. Why do we have to pass through it multiple times at the same airport now? A few months ago in Istanbul I was checked at the very entrance of the airport, then before the gates as usual, and then again \u003cstrong\u003eat the gate\u003c/strong\u003e before boarding. I am the same person, with the same luggage, in a controlled environment, how is it this a sane effort to reduce security risks for all passengers? It is a waste of time, plain and simple. Especially the checks at the gate, after being checked already and not having been able to interact with anybody else that is not a passenger of a flight or an employee of the airport. That area before boarding should be secure by definition, and it once was, as you were not forced to go through security when you had a short layover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I find increasingly possible that if 2-3 flights are necessary to reach your destination, the stuff your bought after the first security check may be confiscated at a second or third one along the line. And there is no way for you as a passenger to know if you will have to be checked again and should save the 4EUR to purchase a bottle of water because it is not allowed to be carried with you later. I still crave that San Pellegrino can that I bought at Singapore mere meters away from my boarding gate that was confiscated by a police agent because \u0026ldquo;not allowed on board\u0026rdquo;. Sigh. Why has security become so convoluted, strict, and unreasonable that feels like tyranny? It was supposed to help us travel safely, knowing that bad actors could 99.99999% of the time being stopped by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it is more a nuisance, a waste of time and money, that makes me think if it is not just a ploy to make us spend more money on the same bottles of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"delays-and-long-walks\"\u003eDelays and long walks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am all up for a nice jog from time to time. In nature, possibly, but I do not disdain one in a large city either. Surely I am not looking to do it in an airport though. But increasingly I find like I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"lisbon_airport.jpg\" alt=\"A typical image of an airport late at night\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelays have always been a possibility. Airlines were more frank back in the early 2000s though. How many times nowadays you board a flight that should be 3:20 long and once cruising the captain tells you that the flight will take approximately 2:50? Me, practically every time. And why, you may be wondering? Because declaring that the flight time is a bit higher than what actually necessary to get to destination means some padding time in case of delays. No compensation necessary then, which saves tons of money to airlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstandably. I am personally never been one that complained about half an hour of delay. Only when I had a connecting flight in an hour. But normally, I am fine with some delay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am much less fine with being dropped at gate 41 of terminal 2 and having a connecting flight, even with the damn same company, at gate 15 of terminal 1. It takes half an hour just to reach the next gate, and if you are forced to go through security again, your 2 hours layover that you imagined spending reading or people watching is gone. A fretful jog ensues instead, weighted with the fear of missing the right turn or stair and ending up losing your next flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish airports were a little better organized. Small ones are no issue, as it takes 15 minutes to go through their entire length anyway. But multi-terminal ones are a Russian roulette of \u0026ldquo;where will we be dropped this time?\u0026rdquo;. When 20 years ago a 1 hour layover was plenty to accommodate for some delay and enough to reach your connecting flight, today is extremely risky unless you are an Olympic runner. 2 hours is the minimum time I would comfortably allow between flights these days. Which makes planning a trip all the more complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"risk-of-losing-luggage\"\u003eRisk of losing luggage\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess everybody who traveled for 20+ years has had their luggage lost at least once. I had, when going through Amsterdam (if you know, you know). It was unpleasant but at least in less than 48 hours it was brought to me free of charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosing your checked luggage if you pack carefully is not the end of the world. Unless the luggage is lost forever, that is. But 2-3 days without one of your bag should not ruin your trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that flying is the only method of traveling that has this risk. With a train, a ferry, bus or car you have the risk of it being stolen, but not losing it because an employee of your traveling company was distracted and did not put it on the right plane. It is an added stress that pertains to flying only that I would rather not to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no, traveling with one bag only is not a solution, thanks. That would increase the \u0026ldquo;do I have everything I need with me\u0026rdquo; stress tenfold. Which is something that other means of transportation don\u0026rsquo;t have either. Plus, I enjoy not looking like a bum when traveling, thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"low-cost-airlines-digression\"\u003eLow-cost airlines digression\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow-cost airlines are one of a kind. They deserve their own section. And all the hate you can summon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing able to fly for 20EUR is amazing. Or was, as these rates are harder and harder to find these days. But if you needed a weekend escape to Malta or Madeira for some sun in the middle of a foggy November, airlines like Ryanair or Wizzair were a Godsend. Pack lightly, jump on the smallest seat you can imagine for a couple of hours, and get out in a sunnier place for 48-72 hours of vacation. What\u0026rsquo;s not to like? Thus, their success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, most of these flights are closer to 100EUR one-way than 10EUR. If you all need is a small backpack, that\u0026rsquo;s still fine. But if you are flying to stay a week or so away, then such a small baggage becomes a too strict restriction as your age advances. Once you need anything more than a few clothes with you, then the price range of a low-cost company is dangerously close to the one of a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; one. Considering traveling with family, where you most certainly want to sit next to each other, then adding a few more bills for seat reservation means that your \u0026ldquo;low cost\u0026rdquo; flight has matched price with an AirFrance, KLM, British or Lufthansa one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the big companies let you flight from main to main airport across countries. Flying into CDG in Paris makes a world of difference compared to Beauvais, which is over one hour by bus away from Paris center. A low cost airline loses much of its appeal once you factor the added costs to travel more comfortably, the subpar service, and the commuting time from far away airports to your final destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am increasingly moving away from companies like Ryanair because of their reduced convenience in the last years. I find low cost flying to be still convenient when it is the only direct route option. But when a moderately long layover is present, nearly always a non-low-cost airline is my preferred option now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"increasing-number-of-services-like-seat-reservation-not-being-free-anymore\"\u003eIncreasing number of services, like seat reservation, not being free anymore\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of added costs, one of the aspects of flying that bothers me the most compared to 20 years ago is what is actually included in the ticket price. 20 years ago a Lufthansa flight would have always included a free choice of your seat, a full meal or snack depending on the flight\u0026rsquo;s length, and one piece of free hand baggage. Today there\u0026rsquo;s none of that. Everything has to be paid extra. For comparably the same base price, if not even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly with other companies, flying in economy means just having a random seat somewhere on a crowded plane, with perhaps free water and a light snack. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. Nothing else is given freely. Not even the certainty of having your small bag in the overhead lockers anymore. Unless your bag is truly tiny and can fit under the seat in front of you, you may not have any guarantee that it will be close to you, or even in the same cabin as you anymore. This was unthinkable when I was young. You had not to fear being separated by your bag while flying, with any company, no matter how crowded the plane was. The worst that could have happened was that your bag was put a few rows before or after your seat, but never in the cargo hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"mauritius_airport.jpg\" alt=\"Some airports are nice, like this one in Mauritius\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday it seems that all planes are too full to fit all the hand baggage, that even coffee is a paid luxury, that choosing a seat with less than terrible legroom is a boon, and that to replicate the service of years back you have to splurge for premium economy or business. It is like planes have reduced free features, while being physically not dissimilar from those I remember from my youth. Keeping rates similar, if not higher. Sounds too close to a scam rather than a business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"flying-is-awful-and-we-all-have-grown-to-accept-it\"\u003eFlying is awful, and we all have grown to accept it\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all things considered, a great slice of the current population is not aware that once flying was pleasant, or at least bearable. Even in economy. Youngsters believe that cramped on a seat for 5+ hours without even a free glass of water (Wizzair, really?) is perfectly acceptable and always been the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI revolt against this. It is no more acceptable to be so miserable over the clouds as it is today. Once flying was a luxury way of traveling, with great service and extreme speed to reach far away destinations that would take days or weeks otherwise. Now plane passengers are melons to squeeze as much juice (aka money) from, by forcing them in the most inhuman conditions possible. Those that can bear it can travel fast for a good deal. Those who cannot, have to open their wallets wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know when and if I will be on a plane again. The last flights I had, both outside of Europe and within it, have made me increasingly disattisfied with the whole experience. Only premium economy flights have an acceptable level of comfort these days, but there are few available seats only, and for most short routes it is a class that is not offered at all. If premium economy seats were widely present on planes, I would accept flying more often. Even if that meant spending 50% more than economy. But for shorter trips, I would rather take one day off work more each time and use the train, which for similar prices offers a vastly superior traveling experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong haul flights have still no alternative, unfortunately. Needing to travel 10000km in a reasonable time gives travelers no choice than flying. If I traveled often such long distance I would be in a real conundrum of spending each time more for premium economy or giving up parts of those trips. Luckily I don\u0026rsquo;t have to, I have flown far only for pleasure. For one or two trips a year, premium economy seats are my salvation. But flying should not be like this, having to upgrade your travel class to have a decent travel experience. It should be the default. The priciest classes should be to have a \u003cstrong\u003ebetter\u003c/strong\u003e experience, for those wanting to travel more comfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t not make economical sense for a company to offer the level of service of premium economy for the price of economy class nowadays. I don\u0026rsquo;t care. It should be illegal to let human beings travel for hours in such dire circumstances, globally. Until this is a reality, if it will ever be, I will be limiting my time on planes as much as I possibly can. The industry needs to shake up and realize that we have reached the bottom of travel quality as passengers. Either they cut some of their earnings or we should not travel as often on planes anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no hopes that either will happen (at least for most of us). Flying will remain terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"Why flying is the worst transportation system we can't do without","image":"/blog/flying-is-terrible/flying_over_clouds.jpg","permalink":"https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/flying-is-terrible/","title":"Flying is terrible"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eBali. Just the word evokes lush forests, rice terraces, yoga, coffee houses, dawn treks, and digital nomading. I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly go for any of those but would be unfair to assert that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t captivated a bit by each. I found them all, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully satisfied by any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRewind to 2021. Coronavirus pandemic and all that. I was going to travel to Bali for the first time in my life during summer but touristic visa was not allowed for those that weren\u0026rsquo;t from a handful of south-east Asian countries. Only a pricey business visa. Me and my girlfriend decided then to postpone the trip to the following year. We went instead to Mexico, which was amazing. I should write about it one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut back to Bali. Despite outrageous flight prices compared to 2021, I went for it anyway. In the calm season, October, shoulder month between the dry and the wet period of the year on the island. In retrospective it was not such a great idea, it rained more than I expected but we can\u0026rsquo;t always have nice vacation, can\u0026rsquo;t we? Heard that the week before we landed it was rain non-stop for 4 days so I consider myself lucky anyway. Overall we had at least 50% sunny days, about 40% partly cloudy ones, and only one or two were mainly rained. Not too shabby for the beginning of a rainy season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip was meant both for exploring the interior and the Balinese culture, and to have some free days on the seaside, enjoying a beach vacation. We therefore opted to stay in Ubud, the heart of the island, and then to Gili Trawangan, a small party island nearby Bali that has amazing snorkeling opportunities and calm seas. Calm being the key word here. More on this later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how did it go? Not spectacularly. Bali didn\u0026rsquo;t live up to the expectations I had, nor to the image that is promoted of it. This is a cautionary tale for those who think that Bali is a tropical paradise, with beautiful beaches, great food, and cheap life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"nothing-is-calm-in-bali\"\u003eNothing is calm in Bali\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may have heard that traffic is horrible in Bali, and that is true. If you hate being stuck for an hour in it, you will hate half your Bali vacation. That\u0026rsquo;s the average time spent driving around the island, especially if you go by car (taxi or rental). With a scooter is better but not by a long stretch. The roads on the island are narrow and the number of scooters high. A deadly combination. If you want to accurately plan your time on Bali, add 50% to each segment of your trip that you are thinking about. 2 hours easily become 3, half an hour is at least 45 minutes and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the worst was not the traffic. There are few moments to feel calm in Bali. Taxi drivers will offer their services every 10 meters when walking around, street pavements are uneven and full of dangerous holes, everybody will ask you for money for anything, even taking pictures in fully public places. As a tourist there will be few moments when you will feel at ease and undisturbed. I guess those paying for huge villas with private pools know it better than most. Your villa may well be the only piece of land in Bali that you will feel some calmness. Luckily I did rent one and I\u0026rsquo;d advise you to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"uluwatu_temple.jpg\" alt=\"Uluwatu temple\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was in striking contrast with the peaceful and meditative image of the island that Bali is known for. Even going far away from human settlements, in a jungle for instance, means being aware of your surroundings for the lone monkey that has decided your shiny mobile phone cover is interesting and wants to permanently borrow it. Nobody wears sunglasses in Bali. Nobody that wants to keep them for long, at least. Monkeys are little pests with hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you think that relaxing on a beach will be, well, relaxing? Usually, but not in Bali. Most of the popular beaches are overcrowded, even in the evenings, with locals barbecuing and hanging out. During the day tourists will scramble for a place on the best instagrammable stretches of sands. Come early or be ready to sit very close to strangers. And the sea itself is also far from calm. It is often choppy or wavy, and when it is not, strong currents can carry you away far from the coast. Every year a few tourists end up disappearing at sea in Bali; the sea is not to be underestimated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore remote beaches are indeed calmer. Calmer, not calm. Touters will approach you as soon as they notice you\u0026rsquo;re a foreigner. I ended up not going to beaches at all a few days of the vacation, accepting to hang out at the hotel\u0026rsquo;s pool or my own private one. Not exactly a real experience but hey, a vacation has to be relaxing and Bali wasn\u0026rsquo;t proving to be such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalmness and Bali aren\u0026rsquo;t really correct to be in the same phrase. First myth dissipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"its-beautiful-you-say\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s beautiful you say?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Bali fans will scramble for my throat: yes, Bali is beautiful. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of beauty to be found around the island. The problem is not the lack of it but where it is and how it is handled by the locals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBali more than any other place I have been is a victim of Instagram. Lots of the most famous sights on the island are underwhelming when there. The expectations are set so high by the thousands of perfectly-shot (and retouched) pictures taken by influencers that once there it is hard to actually realize it is the same spot. The famous Uluwatu temple\u0026rsquo;s view from a cliff top is only a shrine at the end of a fairly large staircase. The view is nice but not in the breathtaking category. Same for all the spots in Nusa Penida: they are cliffs after cliffs, and supremely crowded at all times. If you manage to come at the right time and have the space to reproduce exactly the view seen on Instagram, the picture will look good but otherwise it will be just ok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rice terraces seem lush and vibrant on a screen. But they are humid, besieged by restaurants and toutors, poorly-maintained, crowded (obviously), and smaller than the wide angle lenses of professional cameras show on tourist magazines. They are still nice to go, but once and then you can forget about them for the rest of your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"rice_terrace.jpg\" alt=\"Rice terraces\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemples overall are scattered around the island, especially close to Ubud. Beautiful indeed, if you could see more than the 15% of them that is usually open to visitors. When they are open at all. Temples are kind of hidden spots in Bali, it would be great to have them more open to visitors. As they are, they are a few courtyards with no entry signs at every door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point you get the hang of it. Bali has lots of beautiful spots but they are invariably not easy to enjoy in the same exact ways that you expected before coming here. And while this is a general problem that affects most of popular touristic destinations nowadays, with Bali is 2x worse. Its extreme popularity is mainly due to social media and digital nomads, and therefore our, mine included, image of it is filtered by the lens of the many nice Instagram filters. I was conditioned to expect something and found something else. Still beautiful, but not \u0026ldquo;17 hours flying plus 5-6 hours by car\u0026rdquo; beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrating. Beautifully frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"architecture-my-darling\"\u003eArchitecture my darling\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho hasn\u0026rsquo;t been fascinated by the images of temples and shrines overlooking hazy forests or shiny rice terraces? Again, images, yes. And, again, not so close to reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was under the impression to find similar architecture in Bali as to India or Mauritius. The Hindu roots of the local culture should have created similar architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, no. Bali is a volcanic island and stone is cheap. Dark stone is even cheaper, and largely used in sacred constructions. All nice and cool, if weren\u0026rsquo;t that volcanic stone is not much reflective, nor shiny after receiving rain half the days of the year. The temples in Bali look dark and kind of depressing. Wooden decorations here and there are painted in vibrant colours but there\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of it. Small pieces of furniture, some arches, and perhaps a beautiful wooden roof are all that catches the eyes amid a sea of black, mossy, stone. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that visitors are not allowed inside most temples, where probably the best art pieces are held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"bali_hidden_temple.jpg\" alt=\"Bali hidden temple\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, you guessed it, the architecture in Bali is not as impressive as in other Asian countries. There are no large pagodas like Myanmar, golden-roofed temples like in Thailand, or huge and brightly-painted statues like in Mauritius. It is an island of small, dark temples. Dramatically-posed, that is true, but that is about it. Uluwatu is a splendid example of this. Tanah Lot is much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn complete honesty, I found some of the 4-5 stars hotels to be more architecturally fascinating than the Ubud main temple or Besakih. Go figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"digital-nomading\"\u003eDigital nomading\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is obvious for anybody who spent 24 hours in Bali: lots of \u0026ldquo;expats\u0026rdquo; living there. Lots. From Ubud to Uluwatu, you can find a river of Russian businessmen, averagely-known models, cryptobros, wannabe influencers, and people simply attempting to work from a busy coffee house without air-con with 30 degrees and 93% humidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy they all go there? Well, taxes. I do not believe for a single moment any digital nomad that would assert that they chose Bali for the climate or for the local culture or food. Any of those are better elsewhere and yes, you can have all of them at the same place. It is rather a matter of costs, taxes and \u0026ldquo;cool\u0026rdquo; factor. To my dismay, Bali is cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I can\u0026rsquo;t fathom how digital nomads focused so much on Bali, I want to spend a good word in their favour too. I do not believe it is their fault Bali is what it is today. Namely, a chaotic mess. No. They do not help much but at least they brought a wealth of money that otherwise would have never been caught by the local tourism association. Without the amount of expats and digital nomads in Bali there would be half the tourism there is today, with the obvious consequences in terms of reduced earnings for the local businesses. The digital nomads are not so many that they are the larger part of \u0026ldquo;tourists\u0026rdquo; at any time. They rather spurned the locales to create businesses for them, to renovate crumbling houses into luxurious for rent apartments. They increased tenfold the interest on local coffee (and man, Bali coffee is good). They made it look like Bali is a cool place to be, and that attracted hordes of simple tourists from all over the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is a positive. If it became a negative in some areas, it is not all digital nomads\u0026rsquo; fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital nomads are not to blame for everything. Rather for not contributing enough to the local economy and ruining the charm of an untouched from modernity place that Bali had decades ago. But I would blame more the local government for concentrating all the structures of western-quality in the south of the island, creating the mess that is what goes from Denpasar to Canggu. Spreading out the tourism more would have solved half the issues that it generated. And in truth, plenty of digital nomads congregate around Ubud, which is crowded but less chaotic than the south. It helps that it is in the interior and there was plenty of space on the sides of the town for it to grown towards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not touristic-inclined, stay away from the south. East, north and central Bali are mostly safe from expats and digital nomads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"ah-the-great-asian-food\"\u003eAh, the great Asian food\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, Asia is the largest continent and I abhor the term \u0026ldquo;Asian food\u0026rdquo;. What does it mean? Turkish food? Chinese? Indian? It is a meaningless term. But most people use it to mean \u0026ldquo;food from the farthest areas of Asia from Europe\u0026rdquo; and I will use it with this meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, Bali\u0026rsquo;s food fits the definition of \u0026ldquo;Asian\u0026rdquo;. And it was supposedly cheap and good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither. With a big caveat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheap is questionable. The top places in Bali in the touristic hotspots of Canggu, Kuta, Jimbaran etc. are on par with moderately-priced restaurants in Europe. Not in super-pricey cities like London but normal Spanish or Italian cities have plenty of average restaurants that offer qualitatively similar food to the best ones in Bali, for about the same prices. Where Bali\u0026rsquo;s food is actually cheap are the many warungs spread throughout the island. There you can truly have a 5$ full meal, drinks included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuality? Not so great but hey, that\u0026rsquo;s what you pay for. Still way above McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and KFC. Perfectly acceptable then, even more so considering the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood food is also questionable. Western food in Bali is generally terrible. Forget burgers and pizza at home please. Asian food, and proper Balinese food, are your best bet for a good meal. But it depends. Fancy restaurants offer good local food but not extremely good. I had some Asian food that was better back in Europe. Warungs instead have largely good menus, with tasty meals for a fraction of the most expensive restaurants in Bali. Honestly, I wish I had avoided all the best restaurants I tried on the island in favour of smaller, local-run, joints. You give up hygiene for a lower cost and reasonable quality, and keep plenty more money in the wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems to me that Bali has tried to oversell its culinary scene to the rich western tourists but the chefs aren\u0026rsquo;t on par to the expectations of a moderately advanced palate. At times I felt like I was scammed into paying huge amount, for Bali, of money for food that would be just of medium quality and taste on a small Greek island or on the French riviera. And for near the same price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis increased the general impression of the island that was growing within me: over-hyped and overpriced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"not-a-beach-vacation\"\u003eNot a beach vacation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBali is an island, and has some beautiful stretches of sand where you can have a day at the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue. But I would never go back to Bali just for the beaches and the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"padang_padang_beach.jpg\" alt=\"Padang Padang beach\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, none of the beaches were stunningly beautiful. The worst-looking beach in Mauritius was on par with the most beautiful in Bali. Still good eh, nothing to complain about palm trees, fine sand, and generally light blue sea. I won\u0026rsquo;t discourage anybody that wants to come to Bali for the beach, but it is objectively not the forte of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth because the beaches are rarely in a stunning setting, rarely posed in an instagrammable shape (ah the irony for an island so promoted on IG!), and the sea is frankly dangerous. Yes, surfers will love the constant waves, but if you just want to swim and relax you will have a difficult time finding a good spot for either. For both, it would be easier to ask for a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea currents are so strong and sudden that every 2-3 meters they change and move you into another direction. Even places with supposedly calm seas like the Gilis were safe for swimming only close to the coast. As soon as you were on a boat for snorkeling, 20-30m from the beach, the currents would occasionally become a chasm. Swimming is difficult, and downright impossible for poor swimmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to me after a few days in Bali that it was promoted as a spot for a beach vacation simply because it is a tropical island and \u003cstrong\u003etherefore\u003c/strong\u003e it had to have good places for that. Well, not universally true folks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"slow-down-the-promotion\"\u003eSlow down the promotion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end I went with high expectations and had a good time. But not an exceptional time, nor was ever much captivated by the island\u0026rsquo;s culture, environment and views.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsatisfying architecture, crowded beaches, dangerous seas, victim of Instagram hype; Bali was not much how I expected it to be. Not a bad place to spend a few days, that is not under discussion, but nonetheless not a \u0026ldquo;top world\u0026rsquo;s destination\u0026rdquo;. Also, far from being cheap. Reasonably expensive, I\u0026rsquo;d say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy impression of Bali comes after years of traveling across 4 continents. Perhaps I compared it too much with previous tropical islands I visited, and was deluded by Bali. Mostly because I was surprised to find it a not amicable destination for most types of tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are hundreds of places to go with better architecture, easier to bathe in seas, less stressful touristic infrastructure, and similar quality in accommodation. The advantages of Bali are in its unique blend of culture, its exceptional offering of snorkeling, diving, and surfing, and in how welcoming people generally are. But these points are not enough to make it one of the world\u0026rsquo;s top destinations. They are rather \u0026ldquo;nice to have\u0026rdquo;, unless you are a die-hard fan of water activities. But those are not Bali-specific, and doubt Bali has overwhelmingly better spots for surfing or snorkeling than the rest of the world. Even within Indonesia you could argue Raja Ampat is superior for snorkeling and diving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering Bali\u0026rsquo;s distance from many western countries, the cost of the flights to get to the island is difficult to justify for what the island offers. I find it hard to say, and unimaginable before visiting it, but Bali is pretty much a one-off location. Visit once to get it off your bucket list, and forget about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"See Bali once...and no more","image":"/blog/bali/bali_tanah_lot_at_sunset.jpg","permalink":"https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/bali/","title":"Bali"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThe King and the God are gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelé was a totem. And a scary one at that. For a kid growing up in Naples during the 80s, Pelé was not a tangible experience but a myth already. Somebody who we would all compare to, as the archetype of the great footballer from South America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a scary figure. Scary because for a city being dragged to the top of the league, twice, by Maradona, Pelé was the only one we could possibly believe being better than our God, Diego. Fans used to chant \u0026ldquo;Maradona is better than Pelé\u0026rdquo; and, while perhaps true, it was a chant born out of fear rather than proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an italian, Pelé was the symbol of the 1970 team that destroyed Italy in the World Cup final. Deservedly, even. That Italy was packed with talent and against any other squad would have won that cup. But Pelé\u0026rsquo;s Brazil was unbeatable. Italy would get their revenge in 1982, but that was not against Pelé anymore. He remained that player that was not defeated, we could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelé was that athlete that univocally most critics considered the best ever. Many still do, but less so than 40 years ago. Maradona became the strongest contender, with Messi a recent second. I do not know who is the best ever, it is a discussion that makes little sense. To me as a young kid Maradona was the God of football and Pelé its King. They still are, God and King, just not anymore on this Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday is the first day of post-Maradona and Pelé era. While Diego\u0026rsquo;s death is like of a father figure, that never truly heals, Pelé\u0026rsquo;s is like the death of a wise king, somebody who you deeply respected and admired, but was too distant to develop love. Maradona was the visceral passion for football and the art he showed on the pitch, Pelé was a far away myth, a powerful and respectable figure that you can\u0026rsquo;t truly disrespect. His achievements on the football fields were too high to not deserve only the utmost respect. No matter who was the best player in your team, Pelé had always done something more than him. More World Cups, more goals, more presences. What were mere local league\u0026rsquo;s achievements compared to successfully carrying your national team to the top of the world? How winning the national cup was anywhere better than bringing football as a sport from the swamps of semi-professionalism to be a worldwide star, even outside of football itself? How your modern hero compares to winning the World Cup with a stunning goal in the final while being still a minor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelé came when football was a poor sport, played by rough and occasionally talented players, and left it as a worldwide phenomenon, with professional players and watched in the four corners of the world. He was the one that made modern football possible. Not the brain of it, that sceptre goes to Cruyff, but the physique that catapulted football players in the modern era. This may be his least discussed achievement, but his most important one nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday we are left without the King and the God. Some already started saying how they are not together as Pelé deserves the heavens and Maradona is more of an hell figure. I have no authority to claim otherwise. I only know that my God and my King are not on the same plane as me anymore. I can only lament that, and hope that wherever they are they are at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.I.P.

I can count on the fingers of one hand the truly important, making-things-go-forward meetings I had in the last year. And yet, I regularly have to endure them. Daily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Technical Writer, you\u0026rsquo;d expect meetings to be worthwhile sources of info and insight. And don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, they can be. But they aren\u0026rsquo;t in the form that most companies hold them nowadays. I am largely referring to the daily stand-ups that a good share of companies nowadays have implemented (read, forced). Most of these meetings are managers asking for updates, then each member of the team talking about their \u0026ldquo;stream\u0026rdquo; and what are their progresses or lack thereof. This for a good 15 minutes, usually. Sometimes 20. Then the manager tries to micromanage everybody or asks stupid questions because no one apparently puts managers that know what their subordinate do every day in charge anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, perhaps, 5-10 minutes of the manager giving us \u0026ldquo;updates\u0026rdquo; on anything from where the project is heading towards to how his dog felt yesterday evening during the usual walk out (seriously).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this can not be an email or a 1-minute Teams message. None. I dare you to think otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why do we have meetings like this on a daily basis, spending 30 minutes for what can be written in 1, max 2?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-agile-should-be\"\u003eWhat Agile should be\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/\"\u003eAgile Alliance\u003c/a\u003e defines the stand-ups as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eEach day at the same time, the team meets so as to bring everyone up to date on the information that is vital for coordination: each team members briefly describes any “completed” contributions and any obstacles that stand in their way. Usually, Scrum’s [Three Questions](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-qs/) are used to structure discussion. The meeting is normally held in front of the [task board](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/taskboard/).\nThis meeting is normally [timeboxed](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/timebox/) to a maximum duration of 15 minutes, though this may need adjusting for larger teams. To keep the meeting short, any topic that starts a discussion is cut short, added to a “parking lot” list, and discussed in greater depth after the meeting, between the people affected by the issue.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, these stand-ups should be timeboxed. Max 15 minutes. Never had any being that short, unless it was a truly slow day. Nor any that was clearly defined as 15 minutes. It may have been my bad luck with managers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, any topic that starts a discussion is cut short. Ah, I wish I knew one year ago when I joined my current company. I would have cut many discussions which arose during the stand-ups. Chat either privately or in another meeting, as the Agile Alliance suggest. Don\u0026rsquo;t waste everybody\u0026rsquo;s time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/most-meetings-are-useless/agile_standup_ended_well.jpg\"\n    alt=\"An Agile stand-up ended well.

That\u0026rsquo;s about it. It is an update for better coordination, nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-agile-often-is\"\u003eWhat Agile often is\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery stand-up I took part in drags on and on for double the allotted time some days. It pulls people into listening to other team members discussing their own tasks that don\u0026rsquo;t affect at all your own. Over time, this leads to disinterest in the meeting and people regularly zoning out. If I have nothing to contribute to the meeting, why am I being pulled in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI occasionally ask to be spared this agony by asking the manager if I could skip the stand-up because I had no updates. Often the manager rejected my request because \u0026ldquo;there are important updates\u0026rdquo;. Guess what, they regularly turn up to be not important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd don\u0026rsquo;t even get me started on managers forcing everybody to have their camera on. I could at least do some work while listening to another guy bantering about their task being too difficult or not comprehending what is asked of him but no, my dear manager thinks that if I have the camera off I don\u0026rsquo;t actually participate in the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is what I would, if I could. I would happily not waste 20 minutes listening to other people wondering how to do their job if possible, yes. Let me have my camera off so I can be actually productive (that includes doing chores at home, of course).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of which, how is it possibly productive in general for a manager to read a 500 word text while having a meeting with 4 other people who aren\u0026rsquo;t technical writers nor know much about the documentation? Don\u0026rsquo;t you have the chance to read it yourself before the meeting and let me know your observations later?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do we need to go through textual content by voice at all? While at the same time blocking multiple employees for the time needed to read and comment such content. It is madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, in the end, why do we insist on having these meetings when WFH at all? Sometimes team members aren\u0026rsquo;t even on the same continent, and often not in the same time zone. Nobody is forcing them to actually stand up throughout the meeting, which would actually serve a purpose: keeping it short. It is not a \u0026ldquo;stand-up\u0026rdquo; if the participants are sprawled on their sofas while idly listening to the manager pushing his/her views on everybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/most-meetings-are-useless/work-from-home-standups.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Work from home reality of stand-ups\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eWork from home reality of stand-ups\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the best stand-ups, when they were kept relatively short and team members focused on discussing only their accomplishments and roadblocks, the phrasing was more aimed at pleasing the manager rather than soliciting collaboration and insight. It was idle talking, scrambling to scapegoat others and not taking the blame for anything that may have been done wrongly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho cares other than managers about all this? Why isn\u0026rsquo;t it all a simple Teams message?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-issue-managers-and-accountability\"\u003eThe issue: managers and accountability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich leads me to what I believe is the actual problem here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagers need to justify their salary and time spent at work. A good manager makes everybody\u0026rsquo;s life better, doesn\u0026rsquo;t micromanage anybody, trusts workers, and helps them be the most productive they can be. The workers\u0026rsquo; job is the justification of his/her salary and role, nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bad manager cares more about not being scapegoated by higher ones, faking doing work, and overestimating their importance. Spoiler: you are not as vital to the job as you think. A bad manager is rarely humble. Often not very knowledgeable nor insightful. Bad managers love to get in the way of workers and tell them how to work, which sounds to me crazy: I am not going to tell the chef how to season, why would a manager tell office workers how to work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, bad and mediocre managers have an issue: they have to show that they are necessary but at the same time they don\u0026rsquo;t want to be held responsible for the failures of the team, when they happen. And they usually will under them. Unsurprisingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir solution is thus to prolong the stand-ups so they can attempt micromanaging everybody and have as many meetings as possible. Why meetings and not emails or messages?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause meetings aren\u0026rsquo;t written and can\u0026rsquo;t be screenshotted. You as a worker have no way to prove the behaviour of a manager during a meeting unless it is recorded. And guess what? Most of the daily meetings aren\u0026rsquo;t. Clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Agile methodology is thus the perfect excuse to have plenty of meetings, at the very least one per day, and justify the existence of these bad managers. They aren\u0026rsquo;t to be blamed for the meetings, it\u0026rsquo;s Agile, everybody implements it so it must be good. Plus, they can\u0026rsquo;t be held accountable for what happens during the unrecorded meetings. They\u0026rsquo;re basically free to waste everybody\u0026rsquo;s workday to justify their role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this is not the definition of a parasite, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what a parasite is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be frank, there are some good managers that keep meetings to a minimum, have no issue discussing via chat at length problems with team members and don\u0026rsquo;t spend 5 minutes talking about the weather. They are rare but do exist. Cherish them if you have the luck to have one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0026rsquo;t had this luck more than once or twice. Instead, I had managers who insisted on reporting the job done during the stand-up when all I had to report was that I was still working on the same documentation as yesterday. I guess they liked my voice, I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had managers deleting half the page I had written a few days earlier because \u0026ldquo;it seemed unimportant\u0026rdquo;. You are, you bloody idiot. I am a technical writer, leave writing to me. Managers that get in the way of workers and pretend to know their work better are the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had managers that considered themselves \u0026ldquo;Scrum master\u0026rdquo; and yet were regularly postponing the standups, canceling them at the last minute, not starting it but starting a different meeting altogether 10 minutes later. If you can\u0026rsquo;t organize your own workday, how are you supposed to organize everybody else\u0026rsquo;s?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/most-meetings-are-useless/bad-manager.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Bad managers have plenty of presentations and words, for few results\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eBad managers have plenty of presentations and words, for few results\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMeetings are the perfect justification for bad managers, for their very existence. Agile is a comfortable excuse to have one every day, regardless of the actual needs of the job. Anything can be said in a meeting and no one can be held accountable for it, which is another perfect way for bad managers to hide their lack of competence and impose their views over workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"emails-over-meetings\"\u003eEmails over meetings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what\u0026rsquo;s the solution? Some sort of communication has to be had, regardless of Agile and bad managers. While I don\u0026rsquo;t claim to have \u003cstrong\u003eTHE\u003c/strong\u003e solution, it is clear that lots of the meetings we have everyday at work are a waste of time and resources. Most can be just an email, but aren\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason is the reputedly superiority of meetings over messages and emails, and it lies in their synchronicity. With a meeting you can force every member of a team to sync, listen, and discuss a specific topic at a specific time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is wonderful. Truly. Meetings can be extremely useful when used correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that stand-ups are unnecessary in the form of meetings unless there are blockers that more than one of the team members should discuss about or there are important updates about the project that should be shared to everybody. 15 minutes for these are plenty.\nMeetings are not needed for simple updates about your own tasks, short questions, doubts, and anything that is not urgent or has an approaching deadline. Emails are just fine for these types of discussions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/most-meetings-are-useless/writing-email-from-the-sofa.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Write emails from anywhere, unlike meetings\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eWrite emails from anywhere, unlike meetings\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, a meeting works as well but have you as a meetings fan considered its negatives?

Both the latter can be ignored or, if you can\u0026rsquo;t, can be dealt with in a matter of seconds. With a meeting you lose your focus for minutes and can\u0026rsquo;t even fake not having read a message, especially when camera on is a rule in your company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you were doing focused work before a meeting, goodbye to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"noise-ratio\"\u003eNoise ratio\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmails can be noisy and not get to the point, granted. But you can skim-read them. You can read them at your pace and ignore parts that don\u0026rsquo;t seem to add much value to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeetings on the other hand force you to listen to people prattling for minutes and you can\u0026rsquo;t do much about it. You can do some work during meetings, and thank managers that allow you to have the camera off for this; but, can you focus as well while listening to your colleagues talking instead of your favourite music or silence? I guess not. You are forced to ingest also the noise and not only the value in meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith emails you can take what is important for you and discard the rest. Aren\u0026rsquo;t they wonderful?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"practicality\"\u003ePracticality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a technical writer. I write, mostly. My work relies around written content. A meeting is voice content. To translate what I heard to written content, I need a speech-to-text app or taking lots of notes and listening multiple times to the recording. It is part of my job so something that is naturally assumed of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much better would though be to have the essential info of a meeting in textual form, ready to be copied and pasted where I want, read again anytime I want, elaborate about, tinkering with and so on? Especially with direct questions that have a short-medium long answer, an email is greatly superior to a meeting. Ask, wait for the answer, and copy it in your \u0026ldquo;knowledge base\u0026rdquo; or directly in the draft of the documentation. Simple, effortless. A meeting is impractical oftentimes for acquiring information from experts. It is useful when you are starting and have little to no idea of the topic, with barely any questions to ask. Then it is great to be able to hear an expert talking. But when you have a specific problem that you need to be clarified about, a concise email is king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"waste-of-time\"\u003eWaste of time\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I am not thinking of the actual length of meetings (which is nearly always too long). I am talking about the time you waste while waiting for a meeting to start documenting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the meeting a technical writer can do little and it is the task of the manager to make sure that the writer can do something else while waiting. Otherwise, wasted time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly after a meeting, if a new question arises or something that seemed clear before looks more complicated after, how do you clarify your doubts? With another meeting, in 24 hours or more? And what are you going to do with that piece of content until then? An email can be answered in a couple of hours and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require anybody to check the schedules and hope to have an empty spot that matches. Emails allow the documentation to move forward faster than meetings, with the added advantage that they require less time in general. Win-win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"let-me-work-as-it-is-best-for-me-not-for-agile\"\u003eLet me work as it is best for me, not for Agile\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou get my point by now. Meetings can be useful but are largely over-used, badly used and exploited by bad managers to cover their inefficiencies. Meetings shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hated by employees. Those who do are because they had enough of pointless, high noise to value ratio ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgile isn\u0026rsquo;t a religion. If you treat it like one, you are limiting your work to the constraints and rules it brings with. Agile can be great at organizing everybody\u0026rsquo;s work. \u003cem\u003eCan\u003c/em\u003e being the key word here. Agile isn\u0026rsquo;t a medicine with a 100% success rate. Is more like a natural remedy that has a 70% rate. If you fall in the right half, and is implemented well, Agile can make your work easier. But there\u0026rsquo;s no point to force it over those who are on the other half, those for whom Agile isn\u0026rsquo;t a good fit. Then Agile becomes an hindrance, an obstacle, a nuisance.

Usually I don\u0026rsquo;t review what I buy, neither here nor elsewhere, but I made an exception for this laptop as it was from a small company and geared towards Linux users. Both things I care a lot about when purchasing technology.\nIf you are interested in purchasing it, the Pulse 15 is still available at Tuxedocomputers, you may want to \u003ca href=\"../pulse-15-review\"\u003ehead there\u003c/a\u003e and read that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead in this article I want to share a short update after one year of usage of this little and powerful Linux laptop. Often laptops that look great on paper turn out average after a few weeks of usage. Spoiler: it is not the case with the Pulse 15. It is especially important to update about a minor problem that arose a few months after the purchase and I have been investigating about, and the bulk of the article will be about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"build-quality\"\u003eBuild quality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing bad to say about the Pulse here. No parts have broken down, the hinges work as stiff as day one, no key shows issues and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only difference is a couple of scratches on the corners. Those are due to me pushing my company\u0026rsquo;s work laptop against it on the desk, an issue of lacking desk space. If it weren\u0026rsquo;t for me, the Pulse 15 would look immaculate after one year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"webcam\"\u003eWebcam\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA word is necessary here. The webcam has never been the strongest point of this laptop, nor of many others. I spoke already about the blueish tint of it, which could easily be fixed calibration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I instead noticed after a few dozens of online meetings is that this webcam isn\u0026rsquo;t bright, at all. I constantly look the darkest guy on calls, even more than my averagely dark skin would imply. I often face an open window to catch as much light as possible, and yet colleagues are often clearer-looking than me while sharing similar light conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI repeat the need for better calibration of the webcam to have an acceptable image of yourself on screen. As many other laptop\u0026rsquo;s webcams share similar quality of images with the Pulse 15, not a big deal nor anything unexpected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"battery-life\"\u003eBattery life\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA welcome news for those interested in this laptop is that the battery hasn\u0026rsquo;t shown any signs of wearing out. The same 10-11 hours of life can be leisurely reached to this day, after hundreds of cycles of recharging (plus often playing with the battery and charger plugged in).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo complaints here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-weird-issue\"\u003eA weird issue\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said, I have been investigating, along with Tuxedocomputers\u0026rsquo; support team, an issue that has been marring the otherwise extremely good experience I am having with this laptop. The issue first appeared a few months after I bought the Pulse 15, while I was playing ESO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring one of my gaming sessions, the laptop stopped charging the battery, suddenly and without any notification. The charger wasn\u0026rsquo;t recognized as being plugged in anymore, causing the Tuxedo Control Center (the suite that modifies fan speed according to customisable profiles for battery and charging statuses) to lower the fan speed. The laptop therefore risked overheating as I had set the fans to \u0026ldquo;silent\u0026rdquo; when using battery power. The Pulse managed about half an hour of playing with no fan spinning at all without losing in stability though. That was the time it took me to realize the charger wasn\u0026rsquo;t being recognised and quickly stopped playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I had discovered that the thermal system was sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnplugging and plugging the charger back in didn\u0026rsquo;t fix the issue. Nor would using a different charger, even an USB-C one, as suggested by the customer support team (btw, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-pc128-90w-dual-port-pd-wall-charger\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e seems to be the most advised one to work with this laptop). The only solution I initially found was to suspend or shut down the laptop and leave it to cool for a few hours. That would always restore the proper functioning of the charger. It hinted at being a thermal-caused issue but I didn\u0026rsquo;t investigate much at first. I always managed to play a good hour before the issue presented itself again, and I am not an avid gamer. I simply suspended the laptop and forgot about it until the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, last summer, the Pulse failed to recharge even after a full night off, and even after removing the battery and trying to use it with the charger only. I immediately contacted the Tuxedocomputer\u0026rsquo;s support that promptly identified the issue in the charger. It was then shipped to me a new one free of charge and that seemed to have solved it. For a few weeks the Pulse worked flawlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem arose again, in the same form, after little more than one month. Much discussion with the official technical support over email led us to a few conclusions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNeither the CPU, nor the GPU, nor the battery ever reached dangerous temperatures. 70-75°C for CPU/GPU and max 65°C for the battery. The cooling system of the Pulse 15 was good even without spinning fans.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUpdating the UEFI software to the latest version didn\u0026rsquo;t make any difference (albeit it being an advisable task).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe charger stopped charging \u003cstrong\u003ealways\u003c/strong\u003e when the laptop was under heavy load. Never when idle. It may mean something or nothing, as I tend to use the laptop unplugged most of the time and plugging it only when gaming or after a full day of usage.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe charger was not culpable, the new one also randomly failed to charge the battery.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to last month, I stumbled upon \u003ca href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/1051209/battery-not-charging-but-detected\"\u003ethis solution on AskUbuntu\u003c/a\u003e. It was for a different laptop, a Lenovo, and not exactly the same issue: the laptop in the asker\u0026rsquo;s case would turn off once unplugged, instead of switching to battery power as in my case.\nThe accepted solution was as below:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshut down notebook\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ego to BIOS (to enter the BIOS, I pressed ENTER at boot, and then F1)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ein the BIOS, go to \u003ccode\u003eConfig\u003c/code\u003e, then select \u003ccode\u003eDisable Built-in Battery\u003c/code\u003e.

The Pulse 15\u0026rsquo;s BIOS has no option to disable the battery, confirmed also by the technical support, and thus I skipped the third step altogether. Apparently that step is not vital as the Pulse 15 did restart charging the battery normally after performing the above-mentioned passages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever was causing the laptop to suddenly not charging, it was fixed by entering the BIOS, powering it off with a long press of the main button and plugging the cable back in before booting up. Simple and effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did this happen? The Tuxedocomputer\u0026rsquo;s technical team suspects a malfunctioning of the embedded controller (EC), which I ignore the role and location. As of today, we don\u0026rsquo;t really know for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesson learned: even unrelated solutions can sometimes work in your case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-pulse-15-after-one-year\"\u003eThe Pulse 15 after one year\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside one specific issue, the Pulse 15 works really well. Solid construction, no parts seem to be short-lasting, battery is awesome, screen is enough for 90% of the usage cases, good keyboard and prompt and helpful technical support team (if you are reading this, thanks Christian!). For little above 1000€ it does most of the tasks a Linux user would do, if you want to save a hundred bucks and avoid Windows altogether. Otherwise, Windows is still an option for dual-boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would totally buy the Pulse 15 again. Considering the prices of 4k equipped monitors in laptops, and that they slash the battery life one third or even more, it is hard to beat the Pulse 15 if you care about Linux compatibility and want a light, solid, long-lived laptop that doesn\u0026rsquo;t break the bank. I see that more 4k laptops have been released and prices dropped a little during the last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"One year later, an update on the choice of the Pulse 15 as my main laptop","image":"/blog/pulse-15-update-after-one-year/pulse_15_open.jpg","permalink":"https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/pulse-15-update-after-one-year/","title":"Pulse 15 update after one year"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eAs a long time Linux user (over 20 years), the quest for a perfect Linux laptop experience has been going on for most of those years. I went through a tiny Asus EEEPc back in the mid 2000s, which served me well for the very limited purposes it could manage (the Atom processors were anything but speedy\u0026hellip;). For running Linux with a window manager and writing, browsing and listening to music it was fine. It supported Linux well but was far below the level of performances that the contemporary Windows laptops could achieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a I switched in the mid 2010s to a Dell Inspiron. For many years it proved that running Linux was perfectly doable for generic tasks, with overall good performances (no gaming), decent battery life, a sufficient screen and a not too uncomfortable keyboard. Everything worked out of the box under Linux (running my beloved Archlinux). Yet a few things weren\u0026rsquo;t on par with the same experience to be had using the same laptop under Windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattery life was half what it could have been. Under Windows I could go on for 5-6 hours between charges. Linux? I was lucky if I could reach 4. Moreover, there was no specific support for Linux from Dell. I mean, everything worked yet if I ever had an issue I would be on my own. Which is not to say that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to, or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have chosen Archlinux as my main Linux distribution. But however good was the Inspiron as a laptop, it was a Windows one over which I could install and use Linux. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t born to be a Linux laptop. Linux support was a nice plus, not the main thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, when the old Dell started to give me issues (namely, a few keys started being wobbly and the battery life became abysmally short), I went online looking for a true Linux laptop, with Linux first in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor reasons of convenience, I reside in Poland, and for the good reviews it was receiving, I chose \u003ca href=\"https://www.tuxedocomputers.com\"\u003eTuxedocomputer\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rsquo;s Pulse 15 as the Dell\u0026rsquo;s replacement. I was mostly looking for a laptop that would support Linux out of the box in all aspects and devices, a cool one during normal operations, portable (that meant mostly a great battery life together with a not too heavy chassis), a decent keyboard (I write and program for a living), and good enough performances to be able to render videos once in a while and play older games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/15-16-inch/TUXEDO-Book-Pulse-15-Gen1.tuxedo\"\u003ePulse 15\u003c/a\u003e seemed to fit all these requirements. After a couple of weeks of intense use as my main laptop, a review is due. Considering that very few reviews exist of this model, as with many of Tuxedocomputers, hope this helps people in choosing their next or first Linux laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"build-quality\"\u003eBuild Quality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing to complain about here. The case is sturdy, magnesium and metal. It has a smooth surface, that is resistant to fingerprints but not completely immune to them. Here and there traces of your palms will remain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/pulse-15-review/pulse_15_closed.jpg\"\n    alt=\"The Pulse 15 when closed\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eThe Pulse 15 when closed\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no flexing points whatsoever in the bottom half of the chassis. The top does flex a bit at the top left and top right corners. Nothing that seems to be close to breaking up, and the image on the screen never gets distorted. My past laptop was heavier but didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any sturdier. Overall the same, but the Pulse 15 is far lighter (1,5kg) and smaller (356.4 x 233.73 x 16.8mm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hinges are sturdy as well. Quite rigid, something that we will see is common across this device. I never felt they could be too weak or could break anytime soon (and considering how light the laptop overall is, the hinges don\u0026rsquo;t need to be very hard to sustain the weight of the screen). The screen opens around 150°, plenty more than I would ever need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScore: 9/10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"screen\"\u003eScreen\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen on the Pulse 15 is an IPS 15,6 inches, FullHD with a sRGB covering of 100%. I do little graphic editing so I cannot comment on the last data but will comment on the brightness, as I often travel and plan to work more outdoor with this device and was looking for a screen that could be workable outdoor, ideally even under direct sunrays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe declared contrast of 1212:1 and brightness of 321cd/m² are average by modern standards and just about right for the price range this model is sold at. The screen is matte, so there are no issues with reflections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve tried the laptop outside and inside, a few times under the direct, wintery, sunrays and at already 50-60% brightness set it is usable. All the texts on a browser are readable, albeit not as good as when in more shadowy places. It probably is going to hurt the eyes using this for hours under direct sunlight, but it is possible to do some occasional writing or reading when outdoor without having to pay for new lenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a sort of digital nomad or frequently travelling and want a laptop screen that will allow you to continue working while outside, the Pulse 15\u0026rsquo;s is great. I plan lots of time spent on the balcony when the weather will allow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovies watching and playing videogames suffer a bit from the matte screen. The colors don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;pop\u0026rdquo; as with a glossy display, they look more spent, and there were a few moments when I thought that the image didn\u0026rsquo;t look as impressive as with my old laptop with a glossy finish. The blacks are good enough to not to be called \u0026ldquo;dark greys\u0026rdquo; and the contrast in dark scenes is high enough to make me see quite a few more details than on the old laptop. Which is more than sufficient to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraphic editors and movie fans will probably do better preferring a model with a higher color gamut and glossy screen. The Pulse 15 is sufficient for occasional tasks related to photo editing and retouching and watching movies once in a while, but its primary use is not this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not notice any flickering or backlight bleeding and neither visual distortions by flexing the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScore: 8/10 (but 7/10 if you need to work with lots of photos or often watch movies)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"keyboard-and-touchpad\"\u003eKeyboard and Touchpad\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am picky about keyboards. To me mechanical ones are inherently better than any non-mechanical ones, and I was eagerly looking for purchasing a laptop with one. Sadly, there are just a handful of them and all are gaming laptops. The cost was way above the Pulse 15 even for the cheapest of those, so I gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this in mind, the keyboard of the Pulse 15 is sufficiently good. As with the hinges, the main issue with the keys is that they are rather stiff. You get a clear pressure point, knowing precisely when you have fully pressed a key and when you haven\u0026rsquo;t, which is one of the main advantages that mechanical keyboards have. Pulse\u0026rsquo;s keyboard is not mechanical, though. It is a membrane-based one, with a white backlight (non-adjustable). The keys are on the large side: my big thumb can nearly always press a single key without pressing the nearby ones as well. Size is good then. No key is noisy. Only Enter and the Space bar are louder than average.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/pulse-15-review/pulse_15_key_size.jpg\"\n    alt=\"The keys size is generous\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eThe keys size is generous\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe stiffness of the keys is my chief concern. While they were clearly designed to provide a good typing experience, preventing instances of \u0026ldquo;did I press that?\u0026rdquo;, I feel like the engineers went a bit too far in the stiffness. Typing with your main fingers, the index and middle, is easy enough, with rarely any mistyping. The keys are too hard to be comfortably pressed with pinky finger, though. I often find myself pressing again the same key with the ring finger as the pinky didn\u0026rsquo;t mange to press hard enough to trigger the character appearance on screen. I never had such an issue with any keyboard before, because all were either mechanical ones or much softer than the keys on the Pulse 15.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that this is a deal-breaker as the keyboard provides an overall nice typing experience. But I wish that the keys were like 10% less stiff, yes. Perhaps in a future revision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe touchpad is of a standard size. Not huge like in a MacBook, but rather normally sized for a Windows/Linux laptop. It supports multitouching (2 and 3 fingers), which had to be configured under Archlinux. The surface of the touchpad is smooth and doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be prone to staining or getting scratches. Buttons are not included, with the top left and right corners acting as pressing areas. Again here the main issue is excessive stiffness. It is nearly impossible to press by chance these buttons as they are hard and with a clear pressure point. But on the negative side, when you need to click hundreds of time per day, they can prove tiresome. The right \u0026ldquo;button\u0026rdquo; is particularly hard to press, with a few time per day that I found myself thinking to have done it correctly, but the laptop didn\u0026rsquo;t catch the pressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pleasant feature is the possibility to disable the touchpad altogether by double tapping the top left corner of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere as well a 10% increase in softness would have done a great deal in making the whole experience better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScore: 7/10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"webcam\"\u003eWebcam\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an era of zoom calls, the webcam is increasingly important. The one included in the Pulse 15 has an average quality, supposedly 720p, with a distinct blueish tint. Some calibration at the source would have benefited the webcam, but it is easy to do on our own. There is no way to cover it up when not in use, so buy a small sticker for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScore: 6/10 (but I would not give any laptop webcam over 7 anyway)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"audio\"\u003eAudio\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mostly use headphones with any laptop, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in the quality of the speakers. The Pulse 15 has a rather ok set of speakers. One advantage is that they are relatively loud. With the TV on in the room and noises from the street below, playing a video at 40% volume was perfect to hear all the dialogues and background music. Raising the volume over 60% causes some distortion. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be needed to as it is loud enough for many environments and surely plenty of volume for your own room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not particularly fond of heavy bass-leaning speakers so the Pulse 15, with its medium/treble settings and low basses, was fine to me. As a classical, jazz and rock fan, the default settings of the speakers on this laptop suited me, but for others I know this can constitute a let down. Surely I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t consider a speaker \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; only because the bass are barely audible, but that is my personal opinion and I know many reviewers think otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing headphones of course improves a lot the quality. The volume is high as well, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing all sorts of music, YT videos and movies at about 20-30% and not once felt the need to raise it higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs this laptop is meant to be an all-around, cheap but with good performances device, the audio quality is sufficient for most uses.

The Control Center comes with 3 profiles that as you can expect go from the best performances to the powersaving extremes. I admit not having spent much time playing with the software as I wanted to use the laptop in its default configuration before tweaking it. Only thing I noticed was that the webcam status on the Pulse 15 cannot be changed. Whether this is a known issue or not, I am not able to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen run your custom Linux distribution, make sure to have installed both \u003ccode\u003epolkit\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003elxsession\u003c/code\u003e.

As I plan to travel a lot once the pandemic is over, such a port can be a lifesaver in poorer countries with lackluster wifi signal. A Kensington lock for security is personally the bare minimum any laptop should have, especially the most expensive ones.

If I stretch it to the very end of the battery life, charging only when it is below 2%, I would surely get 1 hour more.

Small things that make the experience of every laptop unique, in a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe led lighting under the keys of the keyboard is uneven. Depending on the degree your eyes make with the keyboard, some led lights shine brighter than others, hitting your eyes sharper than those under other keys. As the keycaps are sitting relatively high above the underlying lights, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of space through which the light can pass through and escape the nearest keys. Especially keys on both sides of the keyboards, like the ones under Q A Z and between the column of Enter-Backscape-Right Shift and the symbol keys can catch your attention more than they should. This is noticeable in many laptops, yet perhaps slightly more here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/pulse-15-review/pulse_15_keyboard_layout.jpg\"\n    alt=\"The keyboard layout\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eThe keyboard layout\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring gaming and recharging, the bottom right side of the laptop, next to the touchpad, becomes noticeably hot.

As it is the area where you put your right wrist when typing, it is something that can disturb you while normally using the laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome users found the backspace to miss some keypresses, but I did not experience that. Instead, the central keys, like G and H and T, especially, are more prone to me to missing a keypress once in a while. I believe it has to do with the stiffness of the keys in general and the angle at which one personally hits the keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a constant \u0026ldquo;scratchy\u0026rdquo; sound that can be heard in a silent room with the ear near the keyboard.

Archlinux and another Linux yet to choose alongside it only. The grand total was 1175€. Delivered in less than 2 weeks. Only issue was a few mislabelled keys on the keyboard, probably because of the confusion between the ISO and ANSI layouts, both available at the moment of purchase. Tuxedocomputers has already offered to send me the corrected keycaps, so that is fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho should buy this laptop then? Those looking for a Linux laptop that is light, can be used outdoor and while travelling, has a good but not exceptional screen and has more than enough power to carry any but the most intensive tasks. At a moderate price, this is an overall better laptop than a Dell XPS 15 or a ThinkPad P15. Not because these are worse than the Pulse 15 but because the advantages that they have over this laptop are not justified by the increase in price. Unless you must have a superb screen or better speakers or can\u0026rsquo;t do without the keyboard of a ThinkPad, there are very very few use cases that would make spend 4-500€ more for those models over a Pulse 15.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNamely I can think of content creators that need a larger AdobeRGB coverage or will need to use the speakers for a prolonged time or want to game with their laptops, will surely do better looking elsewhere. But these are either specific use cases or a target that this Pulse 15 isn\u0026rsquo;t aimed at (gaming). Anybody else would do good at comparing the Pulse 15 with the other similarly priced options out there for their next laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am definitely satisfied. I knew the shortcomings of the Pulse and was aware of the target use, which 100% matched mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"The Linux laptop for mainstream use?

At a simple hardware store, where I would do what I was doing in my room at home in a professional setting, with multiple computers and for actual money. 3 years there and the usual \u0026ldquo;install Windows 2000 there\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;do scandisk on this hard disk\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;set up the LAN by include this new computer\u0026rdquo; were the common tasks that became engrained in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passion of Naples was burning in me too and I wanted more.

Worse, a \u003cstrong\u003elot\u003c/strong\u003e of sport newspapers on the internet don\u0026rsquo;t immediately give you info about the next match of your team, nor you are sure if the time given is accurate to your timezone. Uk media will obviously give times in the Greenwich time while German in Berlin time and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s is not then immediate to have a simple and clear overview of what are the next matches and what is the league situation of a given team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, having had enough of searching, I created this project: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Donearm/when-is-my-team-playing\"\u003eWhen Is My Team Playing?\u003c/a\u003e. It is meant to give me quickly the informations I need, without ramblings, rumors or any gossipping. Just the next matches and the league standings\u0026rsquo;. And only about the teams I care about at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also a playground for improving my jQuery, HTML5 and Bootstrap skills. It uses the great \u003ca href=\"https://www.football-data.org/\"\u003eFootball Data API\u003c/a\u003e. I don\u0026rsquo;t plan it to make it much more featureful than it is, perhaps a search for a specific team at most. We will see. Feel free to fork and implement your own teams of course. It is probably going to break at some point as the Football Data API may become unavailable or a paid feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe repo is on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Donearm/when-is-my-team-playing\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e.

As a fan of pizza and being born in the hometown of it (Naples for those unaware), I started contributing to it pizzerias in Italy and Poland mostly that I knew by first-hand experience were very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make a longer story short, slowly the contributions piled up and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t satisfied with a few technical solutions adopted, mainly the use of Ruby and implementing the list of pizzerias in Markdown in the Readme file. My fork of the original project grew distant enough that I agreed with Steve to make it a separate project and adding to it a UI, moving  it at the same time to a Go codebase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore now the project is feature-complete for the time being. The pizzerias\u0026rsquo; list is no more just in markdown but it is implemented as a struct in Go which I wrote a script to convert it into GeoJson, a much more apt format to handle geographical locations as the pizzerias are. From there, it is easy to load it from the frontend and visualize it with an \u003ca href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org\"\u003eOSM Map\u003c/a\u003e through the \u003ca href=\"https://leafletjs.com\"\u003eLeaflet\u003c/a\u003e library.

He lists all the things he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know as of 2018, in an attempt to \u0026ldquo;devalue\u0026rdquo; in the eyes of newbies any experienced developer by showing off the gaps in knowledge that usually we take for granted, expecially from those developers that work for big companies and who went through a harder interview process. Considering the number of likes and retweets the post received, I\u0026rsquo;m far from being the only one surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan is proficient in React at Facebook, and I did assume he would be strong in fundamentals, frontend (obviously), and somewhat good/very good in devops. My imposter syndrome is a constant struggle, an everyday one I admit, and I was taken back by the quantity of concepts I thought a programmer of the experience level of Dan would know that he admit not knowing while I do. Truly way beyond what I would have hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, as a symbolic pat on my back, for once, I would like to go through his list of technologies and programming concepts and write what I know as of 2018. I promise to be fully honest, of course. Thus, in the same order as Dan\u0026rsquo;s:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnix commands and Bash\u003c/strong\u003e. I have been using Linux as my main system for nearly 2 decades. I can tar/untar by heart and even rsync into another computer without checking the syntax. After around one hundred Bash scripts written, considering those I since deleted as not useful anymore, I\u0026rsquo;m fairly confident in Bash (4.0 and after included) syntax, redirections and other moderately advanced topics. I do have difficulties in finding topics I need to deepen my knowledge often here.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLow-level languages\u003c/strong\u003e. I did my tiny share of Assembly back in the time. C was mostly at high school, I have kept of it the concept of pointers and a vague understanding of manual memory allocation but that\u0026rsquo;s about it. A few years back I wrote and interface for checking MPD status and pass it to a Lua interpreter (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Donearm/Mpd-Info/blob/master/mpdinfo.c\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) and it was a good refresher of C. But that\u0026rsquo;s about it. I know nothing about Rust.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetworking stack\u003c/strong\u003e. In high school I was fairly proficient in how IP, TCP/IP and even more esoteric protocols worked (ICMP, ARP and a few others). I keep a general understanding of what each does what and how they interact between themselves but never actually used this knowledge in practice. Some details as remembering there\u0026rsquo;s a payload, a checksum, Ipv4 and Ipv6 differences are in my memory though. I would be able to keep a discussion on the Networking stack with experts. Perhaps.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers\u003c/strong\u003e. I have played with Docker in the past. Somewhere in my external hd I still have a Docker file for a barebone Archlinux development installation but I have never actually used it. I am aware I\u0026rsquo;ll be using Docker in the future but not eager to. Kubernetes are unknown to me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eServerless\u003c/strong\u003e. I like the idea. I never implemented anything of this model.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicroservices\u003c/strong\u003e. Not sure what they actually are. It may be I actually wrote something similar to a microservice without knowing. It\u0026rsquo;s a vague concept still.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePython\u003c/strong\u003e. Python used to be the first and only language I considered proficient in. It is the one I started true programming, outside school and Bash. I do use it from time to time when I need to try something quickly and don\u0026rsquo;t plan to mantain it. Concept-wise, list comprehensions, Python3vs2 differences and the difference between a list, a tuple and a dictionary are what I am confident I know very well. More advanced topics I have probably used once and now forgot. Could easily relearn everything in a week if I wanted.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNode backends\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve only recently started working with Node so I\u0026rsquo;m a junior, at most. I am implementing a backend for a Bootstrap/jQuery project of mine. I wrote a couple of scripts, thus using it instead of Bash/Python, and it was fine. Currently learning to work with MongoDB from Node and it is not hard at all. Plan for 2019 is to fully learn it to a job-ready level.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNative platforms\u003c/strong\u003e. I tried Java a decade ago, not a fan of it. Thought about learning it again for job reasons. Other languages as Swift and Objective C I know what they are used for and that\u0026rsquo;s about it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlgorithms\u003c/strong\u003e. I used to implement a couple of algorithms for each language I was going to learn. That included even Common Lisp, for instance. I could write a quick bubble sort after looking up some pseudocode on Wikipedia but other algorithms are lost to me today. I can surmise the wrong approaches to loops by looking at the code but couldn\u0026rsquo;t translate it to Big O(n) notation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunctional languages\u003c/strong\u003e. Haskell, Common Lisp, functional concepts in Python and Javascript and even a tiny bit of OCaml are as far as my knowledge of functional languages go. Or actually were as I couldn\u0026rsquo;t write anything useful in a purely functional language but I do know the basic fundamentals of the aforementioned ones. In my career I\u0026rsquo;ve always tried to keep my functions \u0026ldquo;pure\u0026rdquo; or at the very least to break down in smaller ones, doing a single action, as per the functional programming paradigm. Sort of keeping the muscle memory of it strong. I would rather work with a fully functional language than an OOP one.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunctional terminology\u003c/strong\u003e. As with Dan\u0026rsquo;s post, Map, filter and reduce are fine; monoids, functors, monads are quite fuzzy instead.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eModern CSS\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing with Flexbox and Grid. I like both. Not an expert, obviously.

Why? Work got in the way, with a larger role and more duties taking over little by little the energy I had to focus on coding after work. First reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond reason, health issues. I\u0026rsquo;ve been battling with the most pernicious kind of backpain since spring and it intensified around June, when it became a routine to wake up in the middle of the night due to the pain, spend half an hour trying to get back to sleep, get up much earlier than due (like 6-6:30) and spending the rest of the day in a perennial tired state. Rinse and repeat the day after. For weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo both issues participated in making me stop following the Freecodecamp curriculum. Which is a big shame as part of what I learnt in between February-May is now forgot and will have to be relearnt. Such is life, it never stops to put obstacles on your path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, nowadays the backpain is more manageable. I had to follow therapy for a few weeks and will probably have to do so again. At least it doesn\u0026rsquo;t wake me up each night though and leaves me with more energies for the day. At the same time, I left my job altogether. Big reason for it was that it had become too stressful but a lot of it was also due to not feeling appreciated by the supervisor. When I specifically asked him if I could get a title that would match more the increased duties I was taking charge, I was instead asked to apply for a higher position, which would entitle \u003cstrong\u003emore\u003c/strong\u003e duties for \u003cstrong\u003eno\u003c/strong\u003e pay rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choice was thus simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a risk now. Getting into a new career at a venerable age (relatively to the IT industry), on my own, with the saved money on my bank account clock ticking every day, reducing the amount a bit every week, is no easy task, I\u0026rsquo;m aware of it. But I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that instead of being a \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;korpo szczur\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e, a \u0026ldquo;corporation rat\u0026rdquo; in polish, spending countless hours of my life doing repetitive tasks for a huge company that is churning every day more money that I would even imagine having in a lifetime, I would invest some of my time into improving myself and learning, practically this time, development in order to be able to choose a better job. Eventually, to freelance and be also physically not tied to a specific location on this Earth. Easier said than done, of course. I\u0026rsquo;ve already had my share of relatives and friends aghast at having heard I had left a sure job to follow a risky path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne has to take risks. If not now, nearly at middle age, when? At 60?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not excluding going back to a similar job that I had in the last 2 years, for a few months, just to be able to buy myself more time. I won\u0026rsquo;t see it as a failure as long as I\u0026rsquo;d be able to continue coding in my spare time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ll see. To sum it up, consider this a \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;sorry post\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e for not having updated on the Freecodecamp course for so long.

Caring about myself has never been a high priority for me, I admit, so I emotionally recoil whenever an external being cares about my wellbeing more than me. I cannot comprehend it, on an emotional level of course as logically it is natural for friends to care about each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat surprises me the most is the long-lasting effect I may have on people who I have barely crossed their paths during my life. People who I shared 20 words on a party 8 months ago, people who are friends of a friend that don\u0026rsquo;t talk among themselves much either, go figure with me. People who work at my same place and that we bump into each other once every 2 weeks. These kind of people. Not even acquaintances. Less than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet these people are the ones who most surprise me by sending me birthday wishes every year, by liking my photos on \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gianlucadfiore/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, by commenting on my Facebook timeline (and I barely use Facebook). I keep wondering: what did I say or do that made them remember me? I had an extremely small chance to make an impression on them, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to, yet apparently I made a good one, and a lasting one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy so? I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it has to do with the uniqueness of myself. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I am as average as anybody. I\u0026rsquo;m not smarter, more beautiful, classier or richer than whomever may happen to read this blog. I haven\u0026rsquo;t accomplished anything truly remarkable in life. Not yet, I like to add. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing in my past or my role in society that would make anybody remember of me even after months after a brief and occasional encounter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy conclusion is that I am somehow different. A mix of different aspects of my person is something that is not often met nowadays, and it causes a lasting impression in others. Namely, I am a metalhead but I dress very classy, very much outside of what same aged men would, go figure real metalheads. Think of a Nick Cave as of style but singing like Rob Halford. Perhaps this befuddles somebody. To me it has always been natural as I don\u0026rsquo;t want to choose how to dress according to a \u0026ldquo;tribe\u0026rdquo; or a predefined group. I am more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it has also to do with being a programmer but taking care of himself. Aesthetically. And not being obsessed with nerdy things, not having a bedroom filled with Star Wars posters, Stallman quotes and a Rubik cube in a corner. My bedroom is quite minimalistic, as my way of dressing, which conflicts with the general idea people have of a metalhead or a programmer. Add that I\u0026rsquo;m not your average cis white male (I\u0026rsquo;m from the south of Italy and I am brown skinned), nor that I watch what is popular (those Avengers movies make me cringe), nor read what is currently trending (give me a book about the Mongol art of war anytime over the latest women empowering novel), nor listen to what is considered the current frontier of music (95% of all hiphop is pure trash as two thirds of modern metal), and you have a concoction of features that escape an easy definition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it is all this. Or perhaps it is something altogether different. I may never know for sure. None of my closer friends ever told me straightly what they find truly interesting in me. I am thus guessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am though grateful to all the appreciation I received and continue to receive by friends and people who are way less than that. Especially the latter. I truly am. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe much in life itself, I do find it a long succession of painful events intermixed with brief happiness. Yet I\u0026rsquo;d value the little appreciation I receive from near complete strangers as one of the most important source of that brief happiness that life sometimes is able to give us. I may never get why I have it but I do cherish it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"A reflection on the appreciation received by friends","image":"/blog/appreciation/appreciation.jpg","permalink":"https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/appreciation/","title":"Appreciation"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrontend development\u003c/strong\u003e was never my area. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been more of a Backend/System Administrator. I\u0026rsquo;ve never truly grokked the idea of events, DOM, making requests elsewhere and things running outside my machine, without me giving precise instruction when to run and what arguments to accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it\u0026rsquo;s 2018 and Javascript permeates the programming world, whether we like it or not. Thus I was looking for a new challenge to keep me motivated to learn throughout the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVideo courses I hate. Udemy and Udacity thus were out of the question. Still, I wanted to follow an exact procedure in learning Frontend development instead of randomly reading here and there, hoping it will eventually click. Initially I thought I could make up a customized path of learning, so I furiously collected informations on a cold sunday afternoon last January and came up with a \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16VrpJcBornlUmhuz6G0Rztgm6Rqoi4soFnMfUztI7Yk/edit?usp=sharing\"\u003enot-so-random collection of frontend links\u003c/a\u003e. Saved on Drive for simplicity. As you can check, I did follow those links for a while, until things started to get too mixed up or too much theory made me realize I needed actual project to work on or I was going to forget everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, I searched for something more and the Freecodecamp course caught my eye. On 18 February 2018 I thus started the long journey that would lead me to the final certification of a Frontend Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat has been so far? Initally, extremely easy. Until the first algorithm challenges it was a breeze. Then I discovered that I\u0026rsquo;d need 2-3 evenings of tinkering to pass a new test. Sometimes a couple of tests were passed in the same evening, some times I had to take one day break to pass the next one. Letting the brain think for a while was important in getting fresher ideas and solutions. I have a full time job and I can only dedicate 1 hour max per day to the Freecodecamp tests. It took up until 22 March to complete all the alogrithm tests, build a very simple Tribute Page and Portfolio Webpage, two of the early project of the course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was the time of the actual projects. You can check up how they\u0026rsquo;re going on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Donearm/freecodecamp\"\u003eGithub\u003c/a\u003e. 2 are done at the moment, Random Quote Machine and Local Weather App. The first was much harder than I imagined, I\u0026rsquo;m definitely no much good in decorating and making the page \u003cem\u003epretty\u003c/em\u003e. I could usually implement the full functionality of both projects in 3-4 evenings of work, 5-6 hours at most in total for 2 projects; but then organizing the views and rendering it in a way that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be \u0026ldquo;black text on a white background\u0026rdquo; took a \u003cstrong\u003elong\u003c/strong\u003e time. Yet finally in around a month I completed both, with the Weather App being great fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0026rsquo;m working on the Wikipedia Viewer. Meeting with a few issues with ajax requests in jQuery and CORS headers (one of the very few concepts totally unheard of to me until I started the Freecodecamp course). I plan to complete this project by the end of this week and move to the next one after a weekend\u0026rsquo;s break (I\u0026rsquo;m travelling). Hopefully the next one will be completed by the end of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plan to update once a month about how the Freecodecamp course is going and my general journey on Frontend development.

Meeting with family and showing the city to girlfriend. A very enjoyable week, I have to say, fun, drinks, good food, visiting as a tourist your old home and rejoining with 2 lovely cats at home :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip reinforced my \u003cstrong\u003elove-hate\u003c/strong\u003e relationship with Naples. The food is \u003cstrong\u003eoutstanding\u003c/strong\u003e, it is really, really hard to find another city with same quality food as Naples, no doubts. People are generally warm and welcoming, open for a chat at any moment and with a hint of humanity that you don\u0026rsquo;t get that often in north Italy (your mileage may vary, of course). The city is artistically rich, beautiful in a decadent way, there are still plenty of unknown to tourists places to discover, the view from Posillipo or the Vesuvio is \u003cstrong\u003ebreathtaking\u003c/strong\u003e and art is everywhere around you, as usual in Italy. \u003cstrong\u003eCheap\u003c/strong\u003e prices to eat out, a new, modern metro system and the best pizza in the world complete the offer of the city to visitors. It is also nearly impossible to find another city in the world which has the same quantity and quality of day trip to make: from Pompeii (and Ercolano), to Vesuvio, to Capri, Sorrento, the Amalfi coast with Positano and Caserta with its \u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003eitalian Versailles\u003c/em\u003e\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the \u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e part. I\u0026rsquo;d add, which is personal, memories and a lively musical background that no other city in Italy can offer. Yes, no other, only Naples has songs in neapolitan, its dialect, that are regularly sang by the best tenors/sopranos all around the world for more than a century. Everybody knows \u0026lsquo;\u003cstrong\u003eO Sole Mio\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lsquo;O Surdato Innamurato\u003c/strong\u003e.

You go where you want and stop where and when you want, this is the only rule accepted by everybody in Naples.

It is amazing how it is possible to repair roads every few months and still not having a single one that is really straight. In Naples roads are repaired to fix the previous repairing, which in turn fixed an even older one. It is a never ending story\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe astute reader may be thinking now that all this applies to \u003cstrong\u003eother italian cities\u003c/strong\u003e too. That\u0026rsquo;s true. Any big city, at least from Rome (included) to south, has the same problems as Naples, if not in some areas even worse. But none of them has been a \u003cstrong\u003esplendid\u003c/strong\u003e city just a little more than 100 years ago and rapidly decayed after it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure now many will think that \u003cstrong\u003eRome\u003c/strong\u003e has had the same destiny of Naples. Flourished for centuries until the Kingdom of Italy became a reality. \u003cstrong\u003eWrong\u003c/strong\u003e. Rome hadn\u0026rsquo;t been politically and economically relevant since Charlemagne era, at least, 1200 years earlier. The only rich peoples were priests and local aristocracy, and they fuelled a lot of art, as you can see today, but normal peasants were poor, merchants didn\u0026rsquo;t cross it as it was not on the sea and had nothing peculiar to offer to foreign investors. The \u003cstrong\u003ePapal State\u003c/strong\u003e was also of no military importance and never grow up more than the size of 2-3 regions of nowadays Italy. As an example, \u003cstrong\u003eFlorence\u003c/strong\u003e, to the north, was as much as magnet for artists as Rome but its princesses married emperors and kings all around europe and it had a play in many international alliances from Middle Age till the Renaissance, if not even after. Rome has been in a decaying state since 4-500 years at least. Which is sad as it is an \u003cstrong\u003eamazingly\u003c/strong\u003e beautiful city. But I digress\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaples, instead, has been important throughout its history. From Roman times, when it hosted the main \u003cstrong\u003eimperial fleet\u003c/strong\u003e, was a center of Greek-Hellenistic culture and considered the capital of the best region in Italy (\u0026ldquo;Campania Felix\u0026rdquo; anyone?), through Middle Ages with the founding of the \u003cstrong\u003efirst public university\u003c/strong\u003e of the world in 1224, a growing population (up to \u003cstrong\u003e300.000 inhabitants\u003c/strong\u003e around 16th century), and being the biggest and richest city of the biggest realm of the time, Spain, second only after its capital, Madrid. In more recent times, the richness and importance of the city was shown by the building of the \u003cstrong\u003efirst modern opera\u003c/strong\u003e house among the biggest italian cities, San Carlo theatre (1737, yes, before La Scala in Milan), the very \u003cstrong\u003efirst railway in Italy\u003c/strong\u003e, Napoli-Portici, and second in the world (1839), the \u003cstrong\u003eoldest volcanology observatory\u003c/strong\u003e in the world right on the way to Vesuvio\u0026rsquo;s top (1841) and being the \u003cstrong\u003ebiggest\u003c/strong\u003e italian city, and third in Europe after Paris and Vienna, for nearly 300 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday Naples is instead more famous for its \u003cstrong\u003edirtiness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"naples-street.jpg\" alt=\"Napoli street\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe powerful organized crime (\u003cstrong\u003eCamorra\u003c/strong\u003e or \u0026ldquo;Il Sistema\u0026rdquo; as its adherent calls it), magistrally depicted in the movie and then tv series \u003cstrong\u003eGomorra\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"naples-Gomorra.jpg\" alt=\"Gomorra tv series\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecommonly sneered about by northern italians, to \u003cstrong\u003eracism-levels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"naples_is_not_italy.jpg\" alt=\"The always lovely Juventus football fans\u0026hellip;\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand lack of jobs and general lower than average \u003cstrong\u003esalaries\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did it happen? It goes beyond the scope of this post to explain it, countless books have been written on the history of south Italy after the reunification of Italy. Google \u0026ldquo;la questione meridionale\u0026rdquo; if you can read italian to get illuminated. What makes me suffer is that many neapolitans don\u0026rsquo;t \u003cstrong\u003eknow\u003c/strong\u003e even half the informations I\u0026rsquo;ve exposed here and half of them don\u0026rsquo;t feel any \u003cstrong\u003eproudness\u003c/strong\u003e nor enthusiasm in being born in such a city. They suffer from a mix of \u003cstrong\u003eignorance\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003emelancholia\u003c/strong\u003e and lack of \u003cstrong\u003ehope\u003c/strong\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s so common to think that \u0026ldquo;Naples has always been like this\u0026rdquo; that it\u0026rsquo;s astounding that the city can still produce great artists and attract big investors (latest one, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/01/21Apple-Opening-Europes-First-iOS-App-Development-Center-in-Italy.html\"\u003eApple\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e). It shows that among all the pain, problems and corruption, the population is inventive, smart and civil after all, at least a good slice of it. There\u0026rsquo;s a strong identification between the population and the city, many neapolitans consider themselves \u0026ldquo;first neapolitan, then italian\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a \u003cstrong\u003eme-against-the-others\u003c/strong\u003e attitude, born out of feeling of having being robbed of a glorious past and given a mediocre present. From the capital of the most powerful kingdom in the italian peninsula to the third city of a republic whose powers and interests lay mostly in Rome (political) and Milan (economical). Naples was left with \u003cstrong\u003enothing\u003c/strong\u003e to be proud of in just a couple of decades after the italian reunification, not even the role of the most important harbour (that title goes to Genoa nowadays).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday the first quality that comes to mind about Naples is having the best \u003cstrong\u003epizza\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"naples-pizza.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza neapolitan style\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery little for a city with such a long and prominent past. It is of no surprise then that neapolitans have such a strong feeling of revenge against the North italians who \u0026ldquo;stole our money\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sneer at us\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;emarginate us\u0026rdquo;. That feeling was embodied in sport, when the greatest footballer of all times, \u003cstrong\u003eDiego Armando Maradona\u003c/strong\u003e, led Napoli football team to win the italian league twice against the \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; powers of the north, Juventus, Inter and Milan. It had never happened before for a team south of Rome to win the league and that event back in the \u0026rsquo;80s was and still is the most dear in the minds of every neapolitan. If Naples couldn\u0026rsquo;t compete anymore as a political entity, in the industries or in commerce, at least it could in football. Years of shaming and discomfort were fuelled in the victories on the pitch and the main author of them was raised to \u003cstrong\u003eGod-like\u003c/strong\u003e levels by the local population.
