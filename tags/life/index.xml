      <title>Flying is terrible</title>

      <description>I never loved flying. I tolerated it in the beginning. Then grew fond of it. Until it became the worst possible way of transportation there is. Now I am considering renouncing flying altogether.
Sounded a bit dramatic, didn&amp;rsquo;t it? Oh well, imagine how strong is my frustration with flying then.
Premise: I am an old flyer. I started boarding planes in the mid 1990s. Before low cost airlines, before the concept of going through an international hub to reach your final destination was born.</description>

      <title>Bali</title>

      <description>See Bali once &amp;hellip; and no more Bali. Just the word evokes lush forests, rice terraces, yoga, coffee houses, dawn treks, and digital nomading. I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly go for any of those but would be unfair to assert that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t captivated a bit by each. I found them all, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully satisfied by any.
Rewind to 2021. Coronavirus pandemic and all that. I was going to travel to Bali for the first time in my life during summer but touristic visa was not allowed for those that weren&amp;rsquo;t from a handful of south-east asian countries.</description>

      <title>On Pelé</title>

      <description>The King and the God are gone Pelé was a totem. And a scary one at that. For a kid growing up in Naples during the 80s, Pelé was not a tangible experience but a myth already. Somebody who we would all compare to, as the archetype of the great footballer from South America.
He was a scary figure. Scary because for a city being dragged to the top of the league, twice, by Maradona, Pelé was the only one we could possibly believe being better than our God, Diego.</description>

      <title>Fountain Pen Creator</title>

      <description>It’s easy to see how this blog has been neglected for a long time. My fault, obviously. Also my choice.
Point being, I’ve been barely thinking and working with my coding projects since about a year. Why? I got disillusioned. I lost interest in modern coding practices.
Let me be clear: I do like coding and I will be coding in my spare time, occasionally, forever, probably. I am going to use my coding knowledge in my future career(s) as an advantage point and to automate my work.</description>

      <title>Freecodecamp: There and Back Again</title>
      <link>https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/freecodecamp-there-and-back-again/</link>

      <description>Well, first of all, sorry for not updating about my progresses on Frontend development through Freecodecamp curriculum but there were basically none since last May. Why? Work got in the way, with a larger role and more duties taking over little by little the energy I had to focus on coding after work. First reason.
Second reason, health issues. I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling with the most pernicious kind of backpain since spring and it intensified around June, when it became a routine to wake up in the middle of the night due to the pain, spend half an hour trying to get back to sleep, get up much earlier than due (like 6-6:30) and spending the rest of the day in a perennial tired state.</description>

      <title>Appreciation</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been surprised, even amused, by the show of affection friends show in myself. Caring about myself has never been a high priority for me, I admit, so I emotionally recoil whenever an external being cares about my wellbeing more than me. I cannot comprehend it, on an emotional level of course as logically it is natural for friends to care about each other.
What surprises me the most is the long-lasting effect I may have on people who I have barely crossed their paths during my life.</description>

      <title>Back To Naples</title>

      <description>Last month I went back to my hometown, Naples, for New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve. Meeting with family and showing the city to girlfriend. A very enjoyable week, I have to say, fun, drinks, good food, visiting as a tourist your old home and rejoining with 2 lovely cats at home :)
The trip reinforced my love-hate relationship with Naples. The food is outstanding, it is really, really hard to find another city with same quality food as Naples, no doubts.</description>
