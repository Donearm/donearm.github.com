      <description>A few days ago I&amp;rsquo;ve become the maintainer, and main contributor, of this DuckDuckGo&amp;rsquo;s Instant answer. It has been deployed on beta.duckduckgo.com only so far, as it is clearly just a beta.&#xA;My passion for cocktails and carefully mixed drinks is no mistery and thus it was only natural to write such an IA for DuckDuckGo, my main search engine since a few years. It is incomplete, I only wanted to add classic cocktails, not all, and there are a few doubts on the format of the recipes among the community (see the pull request).</description>

      <description>Or why you should be using it even if you don&amp;rsquo;t care about privacy or don&amp;rsquo;t know what a search engine bubble may be.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s in no way a comprehensive guide nor &amp;ldquo;the best of&amp;rdquo; of what DuckDuckGo offers. Just what I find more useful and have been using so far.&#xA;Time days between today and 02/28/2013 = 16 days. Unfortunately, this uses the US month/day/year format 18:30 to 19:25 = 55 minutes february calendar = print the calendar for this year&amp;rsquo;s february calendar next month = print next month&amp;rsquo;s calendar Travel weather = weather for your current location 80100 = search for the map of your postal code.</description>
