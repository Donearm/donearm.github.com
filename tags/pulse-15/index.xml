      <description>I wrote about the Pulse 15 in my previous review. Usually I don&amp;rsquo;t review what I buy, neither here nor elsewhere, but I made an exception for this laptop as it was from a small company and geared towards Linux users. Both things I care a lot about when purchasing technology. If you are interested in purchasing it, the Pulse 15 is still available at Tuxedocomputers, you may want to head there and read that.</description>
