      <description>&lt;p&gt;With my extreme surprise, but also extreme happiness, I published a book! I say&#xA;surprise because I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan to but heard about the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://isaaclyman.com/&#34;&gt;Isaac&#xA;Lyman&lt;/a&gt; and his idea of writing a guide book for new&#xA;and aspiring developers, not too techincal but instead full of advices and&#xA;knowledge that is geared towards those who are approaching the profession, or&#xA;recently started it. The main goal of Isaac&amp;rsquo;s idea was to write a book that&#xA;would teach you a few non technical things that we learnt in our first 1-2&#xA;years as developers and we truly wished we knew from the beginning instead.&#xA;Sort of jumpstarting your career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
