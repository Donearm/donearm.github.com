      <description>It’s easy to see how this blog has been neglected for a long time. My fault, obviously. Also my choice.
Point being, I’ve been barely thinking and working with my coding projects since about a year. Why? I got disillusioned. I lost interest in modern coding practices.
Let me be clear: I do like coding and I will be coding in my spare time, occasionally, forever, probably. I am going to use my coding knowledge in my future career(s) as an advantage point and to automate my work.</description>
