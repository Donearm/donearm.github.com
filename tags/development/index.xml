      <description>With my extreme surprise, but also extreme happiness, I published a book! I say surprise because I didn&#39;t plan to but heard about the awesome Isaac Lyman and his idea of writing a guide book for new and aspiring developers, not too techincal but instead full of advices and knowledge that is geared towards those who are approaching the profession, or recently started it. The main goal of Isaac&#39;s idea was to write a book that would teach you a few non technical things that we learnt in our first 1-2 years as developers and we truly wished we knew from the beginning instead.</description>

      <title>Things I Know as of 2018</title>

      <description>It honestly came as a surprise a post on Overreacted by Dan Abramov. He lists all the things he doesn&#39;t know as of 2018, in an attempt to &amp;ldquo;devalue&amp;rdquo; in the eyes of newbies any experienced developer by showing off the gaps in knowledge that usually we take for granted, expecially from those developers that work for big companies and who went through a harder interview process. Considering the number of likes and retweets the post received, I&#39;m far from being the only one surprised.</description>

      <description>Frontend development was never my area. I&#39;ve always been more of a Backend/System Administrator. I&#39;ve never truly grokked the idea of events, DOM, making requests elsewhere and things running outside my machine, without me giving precise instruction when to run and what arguments to accept.
Yet it&#39;s 2018 and Javascript permeates the programming world, whether we like it or not. Thus I was looking for a new challenge to keep me motivated to learn throughout the year.</description>

      <title>Programming Isn&#39;t Easy</title>

      <description>I was reading, as usual, Scott Hanselman&#39;s blog and couldn&#39;t agree more on his complaining on the recent WWDC keynote asserting that programming is easy. From his post:
 When we tell folks - kids or otherwise - that programming is easy, what will they think when it gets difficult? And it will get difficult. That&#39;s where people find themselves saying &amp;ldquo;well, I guess I&#39;m not wired for coding. It&#39;s just not for me.</description>
