      <description>The King and the God are gone Pelé was a totem. And a scary one at that. For a kid growing up in Naples during the 80s, Pelé was not a tangible experience but a myth already. Somebody who we would all compare to, as the archetype of the great footballer from South America.
He was a scary figure. Scary because for a city being dragged to the top of the league, twice, by Maradona, Pelé was the only one we could possibly believe being better than our God, Diego.</description>

      <description>As a football fan, I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for informations about my favourite teams. I have more than one so the search is not immediate. Most of the time, using multiple websites, I have to click multiple times to see the league standings&amp;rsquo; and where is my team is at the moment. Worse, a lot of sport newspapers on the internet don&amp;rsquo;t immediately give you info about the next match of your team, nor you are sure if the time given is accurate to your timezone.</description>
