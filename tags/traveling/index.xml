      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bali. Just the word evokes lush forests, rice terraces, yoga, coffee houses, dawn treks, and digital nomading. I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly go for any of those but would be unfair to assert that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t captivated a bit by each. I found them all, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully satisfied by any.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rewind to 2021. Coronavirus pandemic and all that. I was going to travel to Bali for the first time in my life during summer but touristic visa was not allowed for those that weren&amp;rsquo;t from a handful of south-east Asian countries. Only a pricey business visa. Me and my girlfriend decided then to postpone the trip to the following year. We went instead to Mexico, which was amazing. I should write about it one day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the first book, of which I was no more than a contributor, &lt;a href=&#34;../your-first-year-in-code&#34;&gt;Your First Year In Code&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that was fine and actually great fun to write and publish books so I wrote another one :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one much more personal, about my passion for traveling and in particular to travel alone, something that I have been doing for more than 20 years, nearly each year: How To Travel Solo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
