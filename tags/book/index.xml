      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the first book, of which I was no more than a contributor, &lt;a href=&#34;../your-first-year-in-code&#34;&gt;Your First Year In Code&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that was fine and actually great fun to write and publish books so I wrote another one :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one much more personal, about my passion for traveling and in particular to travel alone, something that I have been doing for more than 20 years, nearly each year: How To Travel Solo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With my extreme surprise, but also extreme happiness, I published a book! I say&#xA;surprise because I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan to but heard about the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://isaaclyman.com/&#34;&gt;Isaac&#xA;Lyman&lt;/a&gt; and his idea of writing a guide book for new&#xA;and aspiring developers, not too techincal but instead full of advices and&#xA;knowledge that is geared towards those who are approaching the profession, or&#xA;recently started it. The main goal of Isaac&amp;rsquo;s idea was to write a book that&#xA;would teach you a few non technical things that we learnt in our first 1-2&#xA;years as developers and we truly wished we knew from the beginning instead.&#xA;Sort of jumpstarting your career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
