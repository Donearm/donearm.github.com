      <description>I never loved flying. I tolerated it in the beginning. Then grew fond of it. Until it became the worst possible way of transportation there is. Now I am considering renouncing flying altogether.&#xA;Sounded a bit dramatic, didn&amp;rsquo;t it? Oh well, imagine how strong is my frustration with flying then.&#xA;Premise: I am an old flyer. I started boarding planes in the mid 1990s. Before low cost airlines, before the concept of going through an international hub to reach your final destination was born.</description>

      <description>Last month I went back to my hometown, Naples, for New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve. Meeting with family and showing the city to girlfriend. A very enjoyable week, I have to say, fun, drinks, good food, visiting as a tourist your old home and rejoining with 2 lovely cats at home :)&#xA;The trip reinforced my love-hate relationship with Naples. The food is outstanding, it is really, really hard to find another city with same quality food as Naples, no doubts.</description>
