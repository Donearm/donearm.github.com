      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a football fan, I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for informations about my favourite teams. I have more than one so the search is not immediate. Most of the time, using multiple websites, I have to click multiple times to see the league standings&amp;rsquo; and where is my team is at the moment. Worse, a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of sport newspapers on the internet don&amp;rsquo;t immediately give you info about the next match of your team, nor you are sure if the time given is accurate to your timezone. Uk media will obviously give times in the Greenwich time while German in Berlin time and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s is not then immediate to have a simple and clear overview of what are the next matches and what is the league situation of a given team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stevekinney/pizza&#34;&gt;pizza repository&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stevekinney.net/&#34;&gt;Steve Kinney&lt;/a&gt;, a project to list all the best pizzerias around the world. As a fan of pizza and being born in the hometown of it (Naples for those unaware), I started contributing to it pizzerias in Italy and Poland mostly that I knew by first-hand experience were very good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make a longer story short, slowly the contributions piled up and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with a few technical solutions adopted, mainly the use of Ruby and implementing the list of pizzerias in Markdown in the Readme file. My fork of the original project grew distant enough that I agreed with Steve to make it a separate project and adding to it a UI, moving  it at the same time to a Go codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
