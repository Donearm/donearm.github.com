      <description>A few months ago I found the pizza repository of Steve Kinney, a project to list all the best pizzerias around the world. As a fan of pizza and being born in the hometown of it (Naples for those unaware), I started contributing to it pizzerias in Italy and Poland mostly that I knew by first-hand experience were very good.
To make a longer story short, slowly the contributions piled up and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with a few technical solutions adopted, mainly the use of Ruby and implementing the list of pizzerias in Markdown in the Readme file.</description>
