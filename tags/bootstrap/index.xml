      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a football fan, I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for informations about my favourite teams. I have more than one so the search is not immediate. Most of the time, using multiple websites, I have to click multiple times to see the league standings&amp;rsquo; and where is my team is at the moment. Worse, a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of sport newspapers on the internet don&amp;rsquo;t immediately give you info about the next match of your team, nor you are sure if the time given is accurate to your timezone. Uk media will obviously give times in the Greenwich time while German in Berlin time and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s is not then immediate to have a simple and clear overview of what are the next matches and what is the league situation of a given team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
