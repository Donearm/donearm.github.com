      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely had a useful meeting. I can count on the fingers of one hand the truly important, making-things-go-forward meetings I had in the last year. And yet, I regularly have to endure them. Daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a Technical Writer, you&amp;rsquo;d expect meetings to be worthwhile sources of info and insight. And don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, they can be. But they aren&amp;rsquo;t in the form that most companies hold them nowadays. I am largely referring to the daily stand-ups that a good share of companies nowadays have implemented (read, forced). Most of these meetings are managers asking for updates, then each member of the team talking about their &amp;ldquo;stream&amp;rdquo; and what are their progresses or lack thereof. This for a good 15 minutes, usually. Sometimes 20. Then the manager tries to micromanage everybody or asks stupid questions because no one apparently puts managers that know what their subordinate do every day in charge anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
