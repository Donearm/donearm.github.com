      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client&lt;/strong&gt;: HCA Florida&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job&lt;/strong&gt;: content authoring, technical writing, website designing&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;: redesigning and refreshing content of the HCA Florida hospitals&#xA;and doctors websites&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample link&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hcafloridahealthcare.com&#34;&gt;HCA Florida Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience&lt;/strong&gt;: general public and patients&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More info&lt;/strong&gt;: the CMS is Sitecore. I was assigned a few mock-ups of the final&#xA;pages and had to build the blocks of each page, as widgets, into the Sitecore&#xA;system. Content was provided in form of images, links to videos, and plain&#xA;text. My role was largely one of formatting text according to the mock-ups,&#xA;fitting the images, testing the final pages, and think of SEO changes to be&#xA;made before the final publishing of the website. A spanish translation was also&#xA;underway but I was not involved. The most difficult part of the project was in&#xA;editing and adapting the content to the widgets in Sitecore; often the text was&#xA;a &amp;ldquo;wishlist&amp;rdquo; of what should appear on a given place on the page but it didn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;quite fit, conceptually and typographically. I spent a long time revising these&#xA;parts and coming up with modifications that would suit better the overall&#xA;design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in Naples, Italy. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know it, it&amp;rsquo;s a place where art, criminality, religiousity, awesome food, the best pizza in the world, strong coffee, the sea, 2 volcanos and greek+roman+christian civilitazions meet and thrive(d) for thousands of years. Not an easy place to be born, nor one that won&amp;rsquo;t leave you with marks, positive and negatives, for all your life. It certainly did not leave me without an indelible impression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
