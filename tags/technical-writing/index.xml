      <description>I was born in Naples, Italy. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know it, it&amp;rsquo;s a place where art, criminality, religiousity, awesome food, the best pizza in the world, strong coffee, the sea, 2 volcanos and greek+roman+christian civilitazions meet and thrive(d) for thousands of years. Not an easy place to be born, nor one that won&amp;rsquo;t leave you with marks, positive and negatives, for all your life. It certainly did not leave me without an indelible impression.</description>
