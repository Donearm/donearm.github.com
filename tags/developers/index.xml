      <description>Over many, many years (nearly 2 decades now) of working with computers, experimenting, breaking down stuff and rebuilding it, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a large amount of scripts to help myself and in general of utilities that could make my life easier.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been surprised, even amused, by the show of affection friends show in myself. Caring about myself has never been a high priority for me, I admit, so I emotionally recoil whenever an external being cares about my wellbeing more than me. I cannot comprehend it, on an emotional level of course as logically it is natural for friends to care about each other.
What surprises me the most is the long-lasting effect I may have on people who I have barely crossed their paths during my life.</description>
