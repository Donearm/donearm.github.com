      <description>As a long time Linux user (over 20 years), the quest for a perfect Linux laptop experience has been going on for most of those years. I went through a tiny Asus EEEPc back in the mid 2000s, which served me well for the very limited purposes it could manage (the Atom processors were anything but speedy&amp;hellip;). For running Linux with a window manager and writing, browsing and listening to music it was fine.</description>

      <description>I was born in Naples, Italy. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know it, it&amp;rsquo;s a place where art, criminality, religiousity, awesome food, the best pizza in the world, strong coffee, the sea, 2 volcanos and greek+roman+christian civilitazions meet and thrive(d) for thousands of years. Not an easy place to be born, nor one that won&amp;rsquo;t leave you with marks, positive and negatives, for all your life.
It is not a place of science and perhaps my fascination with computers came as a response to the lack of interest in them when I was a child.</description>
