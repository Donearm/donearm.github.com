      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;see-bali-once--and-no-more&#34;&gt;See Bali once &amp;hellip; and no more&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bali. Just the word evokes lush forests, rice terraces, yoga, coffee houses, dawn treks, and digital nomading. I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly go for any of those but would be unfair to assert that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t captivated a bit by each. I found them all, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully satisfied by any.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rewind to 2021. Coronavirus pandemic and all that. I was going to travel to Bali for the first time in my life during summer but touristic visa was not allowed for those that weren&amp;rsquo;t from a handful of south-east Asian countries. Only a pricey business visa. Me and my girlfriend decided then to postpone the trip to the following year. We went instead to Mexico, which was amazing. I should write about it one day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
