      <description>&lt;p&gt;The King and the God are gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pelé was a totem. And a scary one at that. For a kid growing up in Naples during the 80s, Pelé was not a tangible experience but a myth already. Somebody who we would all compare to, as the archetype of the great footballer from South America.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was a scary figure. Scary because for a city being dragged to the top of the league, twice, by Maradona, Pelé was the only one we could possibly believe being better than our God, Diego. Fans used to chant &amp;ldquo;Maradona is better than Pelé&amp;rdquo; and, while perhaps true, it was a chant born out of fear rather than proud.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
