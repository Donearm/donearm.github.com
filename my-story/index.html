                            <p>I was born in Naples, Italy. For those who don&rsquo;t know it, it&rsquo;s a place where art, criminality, religiousity, awesome food, the best pizza in the world, strong coffee, the sea, 2 volcanos and greek+roman+christian civilitazions meet and thrive(d) for thousands of years. Not an easy place to be born, nor one that won&rsquo;t leave you with marks, positive and negatives, for all your life. It certainly did not leave me without an indelible impression.</p>
<p>It is not a place of science and perhaps my fascination with computers came as a response to the lack of interest in them when I was a child. If there is something I&rsquo;m really good at it is thinking against the grain, questioning the status quo and playing the devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>Thus, from a paltry PentiumI I started tinkering with programming, system administration, Unix-like systems (Linux mostly) and all that allowed me to create with a computer. Outside there was a chaotic yet dramatically beautiful city, full of contradictions and strong flavours, inside my room a controlled environment in which me and my computer were developing each other: it in becoming more powerful with the growth of hardware, me by learning to use and code on it.</p>
<p>I found a job doing exactly that. At a simple hardware store, where I would do what I was doing in my room at home in a professional setting, with multiple computers and for actual money. 3 years there and the usual &ldquo;install Windows 2000 there&rdquo;, &ldquo;do scandisk on this hard disk&rdquo;, and &ldquo;set up the LAN by include this new computer&rdquo; were the common tasks that became engrained in my head.</p>
<p>The passion of Naples was burning in me too and I wanted more. I gave up the job to focus more on programming and computer science. In hindsight not the best choice I could do as right back then Italy&rsquo;s economy became even more sluggish and especially back south investments and new jobs were dwindling, even in an expanding sector as I.T.</p>
<p>I scrambled on by branching off while studying in the free time: some translating (the hours reading JRR Tolkien in English paid off), some freelancing coding, a few content writing (I discovered being quite happy when writing), a stint as a professional bartender (which my stomach didn&rsquo;t digest and forced me to leave the sector) made me realize that I would live an adequate life in Italy but never a truly good one. I had to move on.</p>
<p>In less than one month I decided to move to Poland, to its capital, Warsaw. Gut feelings, mostly. I found a very good chance to rebuild myself in a marketing/customer service position at Google, while still learning and experimenting with coding, system administration and DevOps practices (more recently of course).</p>
<p>I kept branching off: wrote two books, kept 2, at times 3, blogs and cemented my scattered skills with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Freecodecamp</a> certification and subscribing to the awesome <a href="https://www.linuxacademy.com">Linux Academy</a> for more sysadmin/Linux/DevOps training. Got into copywriting and SEO consultancy as a freelancer, accepted a job offer as a technical writer and am currently going further into this direction.</p>
<p>Future aspirations? Well, technical writing seems to me the sweet spots of what I did so far: programming/system administration and writing. Merging these two areas naturally produces a technical writer. I would be very happy to continue in this direction, ideally on fully remote roles, traveling the world while writing documentation, hitting the local beaches&hellip; You know, all the things a romanticised idea of a digital nomad entails. But that&rsquo;s for the future, I am not yet there. For now crafting the right tech documentation or the most educative technical article is what drives me to improve, daily.</p>
<p>The Naples fire still burns within, urging me to move, create more, see more, be curious about new technologies, and look forward, always.</p>
<p>tl;dr: I am a content, technical, and book writer, translator, bartender, traveller, SEO consultant, system administrator, and developer.</p>
