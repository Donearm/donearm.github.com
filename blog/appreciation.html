            <p>I've ever been surprised, even amused, by the show of affection friends show in myself. Caring about myself has never been a high priority for me, I admit, so I emotionally recoil whenever an external being cares about my wellbeing more than me. I cannot comprehend it, on an emotional level of course as logically it is natural for friends to care about each other.</p>
<p>What surprises me the most is the long-lasting effect I may have on people who I have barely crossed their paths during my life. People who I shared 20 words on a party 8 months ago, people who are friends of a friend that don't talk among themselves much either, go figure with me. People who work at my same place and that we bump into each other once every 2 weeks. These kind of people. Not even acquaintances. Less than that.</p>
<p>Yet these people are the ones who most surprise me by sending me birthday wishes every year, by liking my photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gianlucadfiore/">Instagram</a>, by commenting on my Facebook timeline (and I barely use Facebook). I keep wondering: what did I say or do that made them remember me? I had an extremely small chance to make an impression on them, I didn't even try to, yet apparently I made a good one, and a lasting one.</p>
<p><img class="pure-img" src="../images/appreciation.jpg" alt="Thank you" width="1024" height="765"></p>
<p>Why so? I don't know.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has to do with the uniqueness of myself. Don't get me wrong, I am as average as anybody. I'm not smarter, more beautiful, classier or richer than whomever may happen to read this blog. I haven't accomplished anything truly remarkable in life. Not yet, I like to add. There's nothing in my past or my role in society that would make anybody remember of me even after months after a brief and occasional encounter.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that I am somehow different. A mix of different aspects of my person is something that is not often met nowadays, and it causes a lasting impression in others. Namely, I am a metalhead but I dress very classy, very much outside of what same aged men would, go figure real metalheads. Think of a Nick Cave as of style but singing like Rob Halford. Perhaps this befuddles somebody. To me it has always been natural as I don't want to choose how to dress according to a "tribe" or a predefined group. I am more than that.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has also to do with being a programmer but taking care of himself. Aesthetically. And not being obsessed with nerdy things, not having a bedroom filled with Star Wars posters, Stallman quotes and a Rubik cube in a corner. My bedroom is quite minimalistic, as my way of dressing, which conflicts with the general idea people have of a metalhead or a programmer. Add that I'm not your average cis white male (I'm from the south of Italy and I am brown skinned), nor that I watch what is popular (those Avengers movies make me cringe), nor read what is currently trending (give me a book about the Mongol art of war anytime over the latest women empowering novel), nor listen to what is considered the current frontier of music (95% of all hiphop is pure trash as two thirds of modern metal), and you have a concoction of features that escape an easy definition.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is all this. Or perhaps it is something altogether different. I may never know for sure. None of my closer friends ever told me straightly what they find truly interesting in me. I am thus guessing.</p>
<p>I am though grateful to all the appreciation I received and continue to receive by friends and people who are way less than that. Especially the latter. I truly am. I don't believe much in life itself, I do find it a long succession of painful events intermixed with brief happiness. Yet I'd value the little appreciation I receive from near complete strangers as one of the most important source of that brief happiness that life sometimes is able to give us. I may never get why I have it but I do cherish it.</p>
