      <title>Flying is terrible</title>

      <description>I never loved flying. I tolerated it in the beginning. Then grew fond of it. Until it became the worst possible way of transportation there is. Now I am considering renouncing flying altogether.&#xA;Sounded a bit dramatic, didn&amp;rsquo;t it? Oh well, imagine how strong is my frustration with flying then.&#xA;Premise: I am an old flyer. I started boarding planes in the mid 1990s. Before low cost airlines, before the concept of going through an international hub to reach your final destination was born.</description>

      <title>Bali</title>

      <description>See Bali once &amp;hellip; and no more Bali. Just the word evokes lush forests, rice terraces, yoga, coffee houses, dawn treks, and digital nomading. I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly go for any of those but would be unfair to assert that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t captivated a bit by each. I found them all, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully satisfied by any.&#xA;Rewind to 2021. Coronavirus pandemic and all that. I was going to travel to Bali for the first time in my life during summer but touristic visa was not allowed for those that weren&amp;rsquo;t from a handful of south-east asian countries.</description>

      <title>On Pelé</title>

      <description>The King and the God are gone Pelé was a totem. And a scary one at that. For a kid growing up in Naples during the 80s, Pelé was not a tangible experience but a myth already. Somebody who we would all compare to, as the archetype of the great footballer from South America.&#xA;He was a scary figure. Scary because for a city being dragged to the top of the league, twice, by Maradona, Pelé was the only one we could possibly believe being better than our God, Diego.</description>

      <title>Most Meetings Are Useless</title>

      <description>I rarely had a useful meeting. I can count on the fingers of one hand the truly important, making-things-go-forward meetings I had in the last year. And yet, I regularly have to endure them. Daily.&#xA;As a Technical Writer, you&amp;rsquo;d expect meetings to be worthwhile sources of info and insight. And don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, they can be. But they aren&amp;rsquo;t in the form that most companies hold them nowadays. I am largely referring to the daily stand-ups that a good share of companies nowadays have implemented (read, forced).</description>

      <title>Pulse 15 update after one year</title>
      <link>https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/pulse-15-update-after-one-year/</link>

      <description>I wrote about the Pulse 15 in my previous review. Usually I don&amp;rsquo;t review what I buy, neither here nor elsewhere, but I made an exception for this laptop as it was from a small company and geared towards Linux users. Both things I care a lot about when purchasing technology. If you are interested in purchasing it, the Pulse 15 is still available at Tuxedocomputers, you may want to head there and read that.</description>

      <title>Pulse 15 Review</title>

      <description>As a long time Linux user (over 20 years), the quest for a perfect Linux laptop experience has been going on for most of those years. I went through a tiny Asus EEEPc back in the mid 2000s, which served me well for the very limited purposes it could manage (the Atom processors were anything but speedy&amp;hellip;). For running Linux with a window manager and writing, browsing and listening to music it was fine.</description>

      <description>It’s easy to see how this blog has been neglected for a long time. My fault, obviously. Also my choice.&#xA;Point being, I’ve been barely thinking and working with my coding projects since about a year. Why? I got disillusioned. I lost interest in modern coding practices.&#xA;Let me be clear: I do like coding and I will be coding in my spare time, occasionally, forever, probably. I am going to use my coding knowledge in my future career(s) as an advantage point and to automate my work.</description>

      <title>Things I Know as of 2018</title>

      <description>It honestly came as a surprise a post on Overreacted by Dan Abramov. He lists all the things he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know as of 2018, in an attempt to &amp;ldquo;devalue&amp;rdquo; in the eyes of newbies any experienced developer by showing off the gaps in knowledge that usually we take for granted, expecially from those developers that work for big companies and who went through a harder interview process. Considering the number of likes and retweets the post received, I&amp;rsquo;m far from being the only one surprised.</description>

      <title>Freecodecamp: There and Back Again</title>
      <link>https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/freecodecamp-there-and-back-again/</link>

      <description>Well, first of all, sorry for not updating about my progresses on Frontend development through Freecodecamp curriculum but there were basically none since last May. Why? Work got in the way, with a larger role and more duties taking over little by little the energy I had to focus on coding after work. First reason.&#xA;Second reason, health issues. I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling with the most pernicious kind of backpain since spring and it intensified around June, when it became a routine to wake up in the middle of the night due to the pain, spend half an hour trying to get back to sleep, get up much earlier than due (like 6-6:30) and spending the rest of the day in a perennial tired state.</description>

      <title>Appreciation</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been surprised, even amused, by the show of affection friends show in myself. Caring about myself has never been a high priority for me, I admit, so I emotionally recoil whenever an external being cares about my wellbeing more than me. I cannot comprehend it, on an emotional level of course as logically it is natural for friends to care about each other.&#xA;What surprises me the most is the long-lasting effect I may have on people who I have barely crossed their paths during my life.</description>

      <description>Frontend development was never my area. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been more of a Backend/System Administrator. I&amp;rsquo;ve never truly grokked the idea of events, DOM, making requests elsewhere and things running outside my machine, without me giving precise instruction when to run and what arguments to accept.&#xA;Yet it&amp;rsquo;s 2018 and Javascript permeates the programming world, whether we like it or not. Thus I was looking for a new challenge to keep me motivated to learn throughout the year.</description>

      <title>Programming Isn&#39;t Easy</title>

      <description>I was reading, as usual, Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s blog and couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more on his complaining on the recent WWDC keynote asserting that programming is easy. From his post:&#xA;When we tell folks - kids or otherwise - that programming is easy, what will they think when it gets difficult? And it will get difficult. That&amp;rsquo;s where people find themselves saying &amp;ldquo;well, I guess I&amp;rsquo;m not wired for coding. It&amp;rsquo;s just not for me.</description>

      <title>Classic Cocktails Cheat Sheet</title>

      <description>A few days ago I&amp;rsquo;ve become the maintainer, and main contributor, of this DuckDuckGo&amp;rsquo;s Instant answer. It has been deployed on beta.duckduckgo.com only so far, as it is clearly just a beta.&#xA;My passion for cocktails and carefully mixed drinks is no mistery and thus it was only natural to write such an IA for DuckDuckGo, my main search engine since a few years. It is incomplete, I only wanted to add classic cocktails, not all, and there are a few doubts on the format of the recipes among the community (see the pull request).</description>

      <title>Back To Naples</title>

      <description>Last month I went back to my hometown, Naples, for New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve. Meeting with family and showing the city to girlfriend. A very enjoyable week, I have to say, fun, drinks, good food, visiting as a tourist your old home and rejoining with 2 lovely cats at home :)&#xA;The trip reinforced my love-hate relationship with Naples. The food is outstanding, it is really, really hard to find another city with same quality food as Naples, no doubts.</description>

      <title>A Brief Guide To DuckDuckGo</title>
      <link>https://www.gianlucafiore.it/blog/a-brief-guide-to-duckduckgo/</link>

      <description>Or why you should be using it even if you don&amp;rsquo;t care about privacy or don&amp;rsquo;t know what a search engine bubble may be.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s in no way a comprehensive guide nor &amp;ldquo;the best of&amp;rdquo; of what DuckDuckGo offers. Just what I find more useful and have been using so far.&#xA;Time days between today and 02/28/2013 = 16 days. Unfortunately, this uses the US month/day/year format 18:30 to 19:25 = 55 minutes february calendar = print the calendar for this year&amp;rsquo;s february calendar next month = print next month&amp;rsquo;s calendar Travel weather = weather for your current location 80100 = search for the map of your postal code.</description>
