<p>As you may, or probably may not, know, I've moved to <strong>Poland</strong> last April.
Don't bother asking why as I'm still looking for an answer to.
There are a few good reasons, which I'm sure the male readers will have
already come up with, but it was mostly an instinctive decision. And I'm 
not regretting it so far.</p>
<p>There are quite a few <strong>differences</strong> between living in Poland and in my 
home country, Italy. Besides the obvious different climate, there are 
some totally unexpected or not exactly what I expected.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: these are just my experiences. I claim not to have a perfect 
nor complete understanding of Polish customs and society. Take 
everything following with a pinch of salt (or, better, two).</p>
<h1>Poles drink. A lot</h1>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/toolmantim/6371671547" title="
Vodka Lineup"><img 
src="https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6094/6371671547_f32442c97c_b.jpg" 
width="1024" height="765" alt="Vodka Lineup"></a><script async 
src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" 
charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Poland is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita">13th</a> 
on the list of annual alcohol consumption per capita. Not surprising at 
all. But if you actually come here you will realize the why: alcohol is 
everywhere. You need a bottle of whisky at 03:00? No problem, hit up one 
of the thousands of <strong>Alkohole 24h</strong> shops all around Poland and you will 
find everything from whisky to beer to wine to soft drinks to make 
cocktails with your favourite spirit. Or, are you driving and forgot to 
bring along the beer? <em>Nie ma problemu</em>, there's alcohol at most gas 
stations too! I've been told there was in discussion a law to prohibit 
selling alcohol in those places but it caused so much outrage that the 
proposal was taken back. Seeing a lone driver buying 6 cans of beer for 
a 1 hour drive on a highway isn't uncommon.</p>
<p>Main thing is, even if most Poles don't like to admit that they drink 
much, <strong>they do</strong>. All of them. Young and old. I can't count how many old 
ladies I found buying spirits at the nearby supermarket. Old in their 
sixties. And I mean spirits, not just wine and beer. They go straight to 
the strong stuff. Yet I didn't see more drunkards on the streets. No more 
than London or Paris. Not even on Saturday nights there are many scenes 
of girls throwing up in the middle of the streets or guys being 
obnoxious after too many drinks. Despite drinking a lot, they have quite 
an high tolerance to alcohol (to the dismay of many foreigner men 
thinking of having an easy time with the girls...). This makes for 
alcoholism being a <strong>lesser problem</strong> than you'd expect considering the 
sheer amount of alcohol being ingested by the local population.</p>
<p>Yet it is seen as a huge problem by the politicians: everywhere along 
the "no smoking allowed" signs there are also "no alcohol allowed" 
signs. Even where you wouldn't expect, like buses or public restrooms.
Drinking is just part of their <strong>culture</strong>, it is not unusual to be stopped
on the streets by poor people asking for 2-3 z≈Çoty "for vodka". 
Especially if you look rich or foreigner. They don't bother you much, 
just saying no is enough to stop them asking. And I appreciate the 
honesty.</p>
<h1>There are no rules regarding eating</h1>
<p>As an italian, I'm used to have breakfast, lunch around <strong>12:00-14:00</strong>, 
maybe aperitif around <strong>17:00-19:00</strong> and dinner at <strong>19:00-21:00</strong>. Some 
exceptions can be done because of work, obviously, but those are the 
general times we eat. Conscious exceptions are frowned upon or 
considered weird. And we have a very strict etiquette about food, like 
salads come after the main dish, you don't eat bread with pasta, no 
cappuccino after 12:00 (looking at you 'mericans...), spirits/liqueurs 
are to be drank at the end of the meal etc.</p>
<p>Poles <strong>don't give a shit</strong> about those rules. The only meal you can be sure 
they have is breakfast: at <strong>home</strong>. Hardly any Poles have breakfast at a 
bar. The most they do is grabbing a coffee on the go but they have 
already eaten something before leaving home. Which is way more healthy 
btw and I hope the hordes of Starbucks, Costa Coffe, KFC and such won't 
change it ever. This is a custom that I'd like everybody to follow, 
actually.</p>
<p>Lunch? They call it <em>obiad</em> and is anywhere between <strong>12:00</strong> and <strong>17:00</strong>. Which 
means it gets mixed with "supper", usually from <strong>17:00 till 22:00</strong>. 
Or, more commonly, anytime they have a moment to eat. Ah, don't call it 
dinner as that means also <em>obiad</em>, but use <em>kolacja</em>, which is awfully 
close to the italian <em>colazione</em>, breakfast, to my utter confusion. </p>
<p>Basically, just eat when you want and you'll be fine in Poland.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong> at the table? Nothing of this sort. I've seen everything, from ice 
cubes being added to wine (<em>"it's not cold enough!"</em>), to the omnipresent 
cappuccino along with pasta, to cooking pasta with a broth cube (!), to 
eating salad, then soup, then cake, then fruits and then potatoes, to 
eating salad along with pasta/pizza/soup because "we Poles like to mix 
things up". Even ordering a pint of beer <strong>together with</strong> a glass of 
vodka and happily sipping either, alternatively. The italian in me dies 
a little bit whenever I see something along those lines. I will have to 
become Polish very soon or risk dying altogether.</p>
<h1>Food quality isn't great</h1>
<p>Maybe I'm spoiled by <strong>growing up</strong> in Italy but I am having an hard time 
finding a supermarket that sells good quality food. Especially fruits, 
seafood and meat. I had expected before coming here to have good meat at 
least as polish cuisine is heavily meat-based but no, it's hard to find 
any cut that is not nearly tasteless, often even the most expensive ones 
are bland in flavours. And I'm used to tens of different cuts, even at 
supermarkets. Here it seems they use the same 6-7 cuts for cooking every 
meat dish, which is <strong>baffling</strong>.  Cheeses are fine, albeit most are 
imported. Try the <strong>Lithuanian cheeses</strong>. Vegetables are ok, fruits is not 
but for the delicious apples (but I don't like them so I'm screwed). I 
have no idea why a banana becomes dark in 2 days here when in Italy 
takes 4-5 days (and it's hotter there too). They also suffer from the 
same problem of Germany: they have tens of different kinds of bread but 
<strong>no clue</strong> how to bake it. I'd kill for a slice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pane_di_Altamura">Altamura 
Bread</a>. Here are the 
usual dark, rye, bread-with-some-nuts-or-seeds in/on kind of breads that 
dominate the market. For really good baked bread you have to go up in 
the ladder of quality (and cost).</p>
<p>Butter and margarina are aplenty and good. Olive oil is expensive, as 
you could expect. They sell <strong>enormously-sized yeast</strong>, 75-100g, which I 
wonder still what they use it for as the most they bake are Pierogi.</p>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kitchenwench/3254936910/"

width="1024" height="765" alt="Strawberry and Farmer&#x27;s Cheese 
Pierogis"></a></p>
<p>Pizza can be surprisingly good, I know a couple of places where it is 
<strong>really good</strong>. No, they aren't even run by italian, real polish pizzerias. 
Fish is nowhere to be seen, especially at restaurants. In supermarkets 
is always frozen and imported but for salmon and sardines. Generally, 
avoid it.</p>
<h1>Foreigners are still weird</h1>
<p>Poles aren't used to meet foreigners. Being on the other side of the 
<strong>Iron Curtain</strong> for nearly half a century and immediately after 2 decades of 
<strong>emigration</strong> has made Poland one of the countries with the <strong>fewest</strong> number of 
immigrants in EU. Something along the lines of 700.000 foreigners among 
38 millions of Poles. If you take into account that most of those are 
Ukrainian immigrants, who visually are very close to Poles, being a 
mediterranean-looking guy means I am looked at with a mix of curiosity 
(most of the time), interest (sometime), aversity (more than seems sane 
to), hate (a couple of times). I stand out very clearly among the local 
population, it's impossible for me to pass as a Polish citizen of Polish 
ancestry (only for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polska_Roma">Polska 
Roma</a> maybe).
While this can have its advantages (<em>"hey look, an italian guy!"</em>), it's 
very <strong>unsettling</strong> at times to be looked at by men and women of all ages 
just because they seem to never or very rarely having seen a 
dark-skinned man. It never happened to me anywhere else in the world, 
not even as a white man in Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Yet, despite my different look, Poles are so little used to meet 
foreigners that 99,9% of the time I'm <strong>first addressed in Polish</strong> and only 
after they realize I don't understand, in English. Even in touristic places 
like the Palac Kultury i Nauki, where they'd expect to see many 
foreigner tourists, I was first addressed in Polish. Sometimes I wonder 
if it's more not being used to foreigners or not being able to conceive 
why somebody who is not polish would come to live in Poland. I've been 
asked many times why I chose Poland over Italy and so far I couldn't 
come with a definite, credible answer.</p>
<p>This shows also how many Poles consider their country ugly and/or 
uninteresting. Which I disagree with.</p>
<h1>The Communist Blocks</h1>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/photobeppus/8300737041/" 
title="Warszawa"><img 
src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8215/8300737041_544d562c5e_b.jpg" 
width="1024" height="768" alt="Warszawa"></a><script async 
src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" 
charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>They're <strong>everywhere</strong>. Nearly all Polish cities were mostly or totally 
destroyed during WWII and the communist governments following it had to 
rebuild a lot of lost housing. They followed the example of Soviet 
Russia and built those enormous, grey, squared-windows blocks 
everywhere, in every city.</p>
<p>Let's face it, they are <strong>not pretty</strong>. And Poles know it.</p>
<p>Still, they aren't as bad looking as some examples of western 
architecture that you can see in the peripheries of Madrid, Rome or San 
Francisco. They have a bad reputation for being "the ugliest ones" but 
it's not rightfully earned, there are <strong>worst buildings</strong> in the so called 
"first world" countries. Only they may look uglier because they are much 
bigger (some have like 4 stairwells and 8 different entrances for the 
same building) and really everywhere. Put a single ugly building in a 
pretty city and it will look like a mistake; put tens of ugly buildings 
in a single city and the whole city will look bad.</p>
<p>Yet, they are extremely <strong>functionals</strong>. Communists apparently hated lifts so 
most of them which are less than 6-7 floors have none. Some have 
installed one after the coming of democracy. So no lifts for shorter 
buildings. But the stairs are <strong>large</strong>. The steps aren't too tall or too 
narrow. I bet some russian architect made a research on this and found 
the precise size they should be. My 42 EU size feet fits perfectly. 
Amazing. Main building door is 99% of the time activated by an 
electronic system where you press the number of your apartment, the key 
button and a 4 digit code to open the door. Alternatively, there's the 
key. It's a bit like in Ukraine but over there is still mechanical.</p>
<p>And the rooms inside are <strong>warm</strong>. Very. The external walls are thick while 
the walls separating two apartments are not, which helps to keep the 
cold away and sharing the heating warmness from apartment to adjacent 
apartment (and also hearing the discussions of your neighbours). Every 
building has a <strong>basement</strong>, including new ones, where you can store some of your 
stuff, included in the rent. Also most if not all have a stair to access 
the roof which Poles don't use it at all as I haven't seen anybody on 
any roof in 5 months of staying (and it was during summer). A large part 
of all buildings have room to park the car/bike in front or on the back 
of them, many green areas around and occasionally a <strong>recreational 
area</strong> with basketball court, ping pong table and entertainment area for 
children. Speaking of which, I've seen toys inside bank offices, in 
every airport and even in a few big shops. They do care about the 
children (but they don't make 
<a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/poland/birth-rate">many anymore</a>). </p>
<h1>Beds</h1>
<p>A bed is a bed. <strong>This is a bed</strong> (as the wise cat clearly agrees):</p>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/koldre/544234299" title="Ikea Mandal 
Bed"><img 
src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1154/544234299_dcfc309eb5_b.jpg" 
width="819" height="1024" alt="Ikea Mandal Bed"></a><script async 
src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" 
charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>Anything else isn't</strong>. In Poland they often try to sell you a <strong>sofa-bed</strong> for 
a bed. It is not, dear Polish friends; it's just a sofa that can be 
opened and you can sleep on. That doesn't make it a bed as much as being 
able to sleep on an airplane seat make it a proper bed. Understood?</p>
<h1>The Language</h1>
<p>Every foreigner here has to face it on a day to day basis: <strong>Polish is 
hard</strong>. And every foreigner complains about it. And every Poles understand 
it's impossible to master it in less than <strong>1 year</strong>. Or <strong>2</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think it needs so long at all. 1 year is a good 
guess for most, intelligent, people. 2 only if you don't give studying 
Polish much time or are very bad at languages in general. The worst part 
are the many <strong>declension cases</strong> (which was expected) and the <strong>pronunciation</strong> 
(which was not): one dipthong like <em>"rz"</em>, <em>"sz"</em>, <em>"cz"</em>, or difficult sounds 
like <em>"≈Ç"</em> are easy enough to pronounce (and they don't change according 
to the position!), but when more than 1 is present in a single word my 
brain spins. Try to pronounce words like <strong>"Szczebrzeszynie"</strong> or 
<strong>"chrzƒÖszcz"</strong> (but have first at hand the number of your otolaryngologist 
for when your tongue gets stuck).</p>
<p>So get ready to use <em>"nie mowie po polsku"</em> (I don't speak Polish) very 
often and take aside 1 hour each day to study Polish if you are serious 
about staying in Poland. Which it is supposed to be your duty as a 
modern, globalized citizen of the world.</p>
<p>But I know most won't care, so <strong>English will be your anchor</strong>. Luckily for 
them, 90% of the younger generations, &lt;30yo, know basic to average 
english. Some have really amazing english levels. Yet it's not 
Netherlands or Scandinavia, as soon as you are outside of the most 
touristic areas even speaking with 20yo people will become hard if not 
totally impossible. There's a huge <strong>gap</strong> between well educated people and 
those who have average or lower than average education: the english of 
the latter will be at most basic, if not that bad that they could as 
well speak polish. If you consider that many 40+ well educated people 
<strong>didn't study english at school</strong> at all (because, Russians!), you can 
imagine how small is the population range that a foreigner can have a 
normal discussion in english. The situation is clearly improving, in 20 
years you could live here like you can now in Scandinavia, without any 
knowledge of the local language, but for now be warned.</p>
<h1>Traffic is amazingly low</h1>
<p>I'm sure all my polish friends will cry in <strong>outrage</strong> at this but trust me, 
it's nowhere near what it's like to drive in Rome or Naples. That's hell 
on earth compared to Warsaw. There's a reason why we say</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>if you can drive in Naples, you can drive everywhere
</pre></div>


<p>and it's not because of the very strict driving schools. Seriously, 
traffic is mostly smooth but for a couple of spots at the usual rush 
hours. Finding a parking spot for your car is unbelievably easier than 
back in Italy: in Warsaw's centre, in front of the Palace of Justice, 
you can be sure to find an empty spot at every hour. Nothing of this 
sort can be said for any major italian city; if I had found one like 
that I would consider it <strong>my lucky day</strong>. Here it seems normal to have a 
few empty spots here and there even in the very centre of the city on a 
weekday morning. I guess because most poles don't have a car (due to 
poverty or choice) and rely on the, mostly <strong>excellent</strong>, public 
transportation and bike lanes systems. Admittedly, I don't feel the 
need to buy a car anytime soon either. Streets are also very wide and 
there's room to park cars everywhere. But don't try to park your car too 
close to a turn, it will get <strong>confiscated</strong> in a nanosecond and you will be 
frowned upon by any bystander. I saw it myself and it wasn't nice for 
the driver, as much as it wasn't for the driver who got invested by a 
tram because he didn't clear up the path for it and was also <strong>fined</strong> 
for interrupting public transportation.</p>
<p>Trams are <strong>evil</strong> here, don't mess with them.</p>
<h1>Weather</h1>
<p>I talk about the weather last, contrarily to most foreigners (trying to 
be original, see?). I have not yet experienced the <strong>cold polish 
winter</strong> but for a brief stint last year when I made a supervising trip 
of 5 days. That was enough to give me a good idea though.</p>
<p>Yes, it is <strong>cold</strong>. Grey too. And extremely <strong>windy</strong>, which is the worst thing 
you can face when on a 50m wide and 2km long street without any covering 
but for leafeless trees. Try to cross a bridge over the Vistula in the 
middle of the winter and I'm sure you will be ready to be sold as frozen 
meat before you reach the other end. <strong>Nobody</strong> crosses a bridge here in 
winter. Nobody that plans to survive, at least. Often walking out feels 
like a race from a heated place to the next with the prize being 
survival. Once I took the road from the Stadion Narodowy (the football 
stadium) north towards the Praga neighborhood along the river because I 
got off the tram one stop earlier than I intended: <strong>worst decision ever</strong>. 
It was like 1km or even less but I felt like the poor Athenian soldier 
running back to Athens after Marathon battle. Only with harsh cold and 
strong wind.</p>
<p>Yet is getting <strong>better</strong>. Last winter was below -10¬∞C only for a couple of 
weeks, most of the time was between 0 and -10, which is mild here. 
Spring has been pretty ok and sunny and this summer has been universally 
considered as one of the warmest ever. It felt like Italy a handful of 
days. We have hope this winter won't be that bad after all.</p>
<p>If it won't, luckily, as I said above, houses are usually very warm. 
Restaurant and bars even more as they put the heating system to the 
maximum out of sheer <strong>hate of winter</strong>, there's no other possible 
explanation: it is normal to stay in t-shirts inside and then having to 
put 3 layers on before going out. Perfect to get a cold. Which 
considering the <strong>abnormal</strong> number of pharmacies available seems to be 
quite common.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>All in all I'm <strong>enjoying</strong> my staying in Poland. People are generally very 
nice, educated and respectful. Honest too. The problems I have told of 
above aren't that bad, nothing that would make me decide to go back to 
Italy. Poland at least is improving its shortcomings, Italy has been 
<strong>stagnating</strong> for decades. Unfortunately, not just the economy.</p>
